    "label": "Riding on camelback, the Tuareg once controlled the caravan routes that stretched across the Sahara. Their economy was based on herding and supplemented by the trade of salt. Tuareg nobility depended on a worker class to tend its flocks, a slave class to meet its domestic needs, and an artisan class to produce leather, wood, and metal goods, like this very saddle. Tuareg artisans make camel saddles by covering a wooden core with dyed leather. Then, they decorate the pommel and other parts of the saddle with metal embellishments filled with geometric patterns, similar to those found in Tuareg jewelry of the same period (desired comparative image). Ornate saddles like this one would probably not be used for lengthy travel, but, rather, for special occasions.  Until the widespread adoption of the camel in the early centuries of the Common Era, historians believe that trans-Saharan trade and exchange was quite rare. Camels are ideal for Saharan movement for their endurance: they rarely sweat, even in hot desert climates, and can conserve fluids for long periods of time.",

Approximately two-thirds of the beads are from lower occupation levels, dated to the eighth to tenth centuries in broken, malformed, or unfinished condition.

Fragments suggest, for instance, that beads were cut from glass canes and then heated in order to smooth their edges, and that broken glassware was melted to make beads. Glass beads are recognized as objects of power, affluence, ritual, commerce, and social status in many African societies. At local and, to some extent, regional levels, the production of glass beads in medieval brought about dramatic social, political, and economic transformations: a period of “bleaded splendor”. The demand for these glass beads were largely ornamental, though as costly items of prestige they would have constituted signs of rank.

Their discovery 389 Kilometers southeast of Ile-Ife it suggests an internal exchange of beads. Yet, of the 165,000 of stone and glass beads found at Igbo Ukwu, a lot of lead and elemental isotopes also link the beads to the Mediterranean, the Levant, Middle East, Arabia, and India. The beads offer an interesting look into both the local south-north trade and the importance of Igbo Ukwu in the larger trans-Saharan network; beads of similar material composition were also found at Gao and Tadmekka in Mali. These discoveries establishes that significant glass bead production was underway in the forest region at Igbo Olokun, and that these beads were part of a global circulation of glass beads.",

Analysis of copperwork from Igbo Ukwu suggests that metal casters there supplemented locally sourced copper with copper from mines in Tunisian or Moroccan. Igbo Ukwu had local metal to use but most other regions did not which made copper very valuable. In 1324, Cairene author al-‘Umarī wrote that copper sold for two-thirds its weight in gold. But sub-Saharan trade still affected Igbo Ukwu. Local production of copper was severely affected by the increased presence of brass imported from across the Sahara by Arab traders from the eleventh and twelfth centuries (Craddock et. al., 426). The raised ropes and dots reference the beads found at Igbo Ukwu, which circulated internally and abroad. Attached at the copper-alloy pendant are yellow glass beads strung on copper wires. Yellow beads do not have the high-lime, high-aluminum content common between the blue beads of Igbo Ukwu and the production site of Igbo-Olkon.",

Every Friday it was taken to the Niger River to be ritually bathed with sand and water, accompanied by chants in Yoruba, a language associated with the city of Ife. Its casting style and the fact that it wears a wrapper with a sash tied on its left hip (which is characteristic of Ife culture), further associates the figure with Ile-Ife during the late thirteenth to fourteenth century. Ife was the capital of a powerful state 120 miles south of Tada. In the medieval period, Tada’s location would have been of strategic importance to Ife, connecting it with long-distance trade. As an indication, analysis of the raw copper from which the statue is made suggests that it might have originated in France, traveling along these very trade routes to Ife, where it was cast.",

Similar ingots have been found in three other sites, bu tonly those recently excavated by Sam Nixon in Tamdult have the identical triangular shape, whereas the others found in Maden Ifajen and Natamatao are cylindrical. These ingots were later made into jewelry or regalia and sculpture, like the leglets, armlet, leg bracelets, and heavy arm rings also found in the burials. However, these long brass ingots were buried as grave goods and it is believed that they were exclusively made to symbolize commodity and indicate wealth. ",

The pendant, however has five soldered cabochon ornaments and is outlined with braided filigree, which is very similar in craftsmanship to the Rao Pectoral and the jewelry from the Salcombe Bay treasure. This pendant was most likely traded and traveled as a finished object over West Africa, and therefore had different origins from the earrings. These treasures were acquired through trade in multiple directions, and therefore provide evidence for a far reaching interaction. Studies of the gold jewelry indicate that they were likely made in Senegal or southern Mauritania, while the other cowrie shells originated in the Indian Ocean and would have traveled along the same routes of trade as the brass bowl.",

Unlike other West African societies, Akan culture used gold for internal transactions such as food, taxes, and marriage settlements.

Most currency production was attributed to north of the Sahara. The 2005 excavations at Tadmekka uncovered the very terracotta fragments with cup-like indentations that substantiates Al-Bakri’s account. The three small circular pieces immediately suggest their original function as molds. Subsequent examinations and research not only concluded that these forms relate to known traditions of coin production, but also detected small droplets of gold adhered to one of the indentations. Working with the archaeologist who recovered the mold fragments, material scientists from Northwestern University have tested a process for purifying and casting gold using the same material resources available at Tadmekka. Gold dust was melted and filtered through crushed glass to purify it. Copies of the mold fragments were then used by the scientists to cast replica blank dinars in bronze. Using the domestic ceramic fabric found at Tadmekka, the molds differ in their superficial vitrification from the high-temperature firing process.",
