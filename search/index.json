    "description": "Until the widespread domestication of the camel in the early centuries of the Common Era, historians believe that trans-Saharan trade and exchange was quite rare. Camels are ideal for Saharan movement: they rarely sweat, even in hot desert climates, and can conserve fluids for long periods of time. With camels to ride and to carry loads, the Tuareg and other peoples of the Sahara once controlled the caravan routes that stretched across the desert. \n \n Their economy was based on herding and supplemented by the trade of salt. Tuareg nobility depended on a worker class to tend flocks, a slave class to meet domestic needs, and an artisan class to produce leather, wood, and metal goods, like this saddle. This saddle is too ornate to have been used for lengthy travel. It was made by covering a wooden core with dyed and tooled leather and then decorating the pommel and other parts with metal embellishments filled with geometric patterns.",

    "description": "Vast amounts of unglazed ceramic fragments— the remains of bottles, bowls, jars, storage containers, and other items essential to daily life—have been excavated at multiple sites in the Western Sudan region, and even north of the Sahara at sites including Sijilmasa. This distribution across sites from the Inland Niger Delta to the Northern Sahara has led archaeologists to speculate that ceramic containers were used to carry goods, such as shea butter or honey, short and long distances in trade. They are decorated with imprinted roulette patterns or slip-painted motifs. Some of the fragments are predicted to have been parts of containers for products like shea butter and honey. Because of their distribution across sites from the Inland Niger Delta to the Northern Sahara archaeologists speculate that ceramic containers were used to carry goods, such as shea butter or honey, short and long distances in trade.",

Approximately two-thirds of the beads are from the lower occupation levels, dated to the eighth to tenth centuries, with many of those found in trenches in broken, malformed, or unfinished condition. The evidence from these trenches is especially compelling, suggesting that Gao was a production site for recycling and remaking imported glass.",

They are part of a widespread local terracotta sculpture tradition, stretching from 10th to 15th century. The Niger River’s fertile inland delta supported a thriving urbanism in the Middle Ages that included more than 60 interdependent communities. At Natamatao, excavations unearthed materials associated with trans-Saharan trade, notably a bundle of imported copper ingots. Bracelets and pendants, like those depicted on the kneeling figure, might well have been made of brass, a copper alloy. The depiction of horses likewise points to commerce, as they were traded across the Sahara.",

This drawing of a guinbri is from the Danish businessman and diplomat Georg Høst’s account of his travels in Morocco.

The measure and its increments became standard units for weighing gold wherever Roman coins were used, and they continued to be used by Islamic states in North Africa and the Middle East during the Middle Ages.

In this panel painting from Italy, Christ places a crown on the head of his mother, Mary, symbolizing her role as Queen of Heaven. Angels and other holy figures fill the heavenly space that is conveyed by the golden background. Much of the gold used in Italy came from West Africa through trans-Saharan trade routes. Beginning in the 13th century, Italian city-states, such as Florence and Venice, began minting gold coins largely made from West African gold. These coins were beaten into thin sheets of foil, which were then used as gold leaf. From one coin, craftsmen could make more than one hundred leaves. Biconical beads became dispersed widely across the Mediterranean and the Sahara in the medieval period. Small terracotta beads from Gao, Mali, feature the same double cone shape, showing evidence of this form's movement.",

    "description": "The page of this sumptuous Qur'an feature gold and silver script on indigo-colored parchment. The Blue Qur'an was housed in the library of the Great Mosque of Kairouan in Tunisia from at least 1294. Today, more than 100 of its 600 pages are dispersed in collections around the world and approximately sixty seven are still in Tunisia. Although scholars disagree on the precise origins of this sumptuous book, the use of gold and silver script on parchment colored a deep blue nevertheless signals competition with the expensive purple-dyed manuscripts (from the murex sea snail) also circulating in courts around the Mediterranean basin. During the medieval period, a shared manuscript culture among Muslims, Christians, and Jews extended across North Africa, the Middle East, and Europe. Common elements in this manuscript tradition included elegant calligraphy; colorful embellishments including gold; and decorative leather bindings. Gold and leather, both prominently used in bookmaking, were imported from West Africa. Book culture likewise spread to West Africa as Islam spread across the Sahara Desert.",

Two elephant subspecies are found in West Africa: the Savanna elephant, which is the largest of all Elephant species, and the forest elephant. The tusks of both elephants were circulated through medieval trans-Saharan trade. Large-scale Virgin and Child statuettes represent the apex of ivory carving in the medieval period in France, and this sculpture is among the largest. Measuring 16.5 cm in diameter at its widest point, the solid statuette could only have been made from the tusk of a Savanna elephant. The artist has maximized the size of the figures of the Virgin and Child obtained from the large tusk and augmented it further by adding separate ivory pieces to make the throne. This statuette was finished with fine details in paint and gold.",

While documents of the period suggest that luxurious embroidered garments were worn by the elite, the majority of surviving embroideries were made for use in the church. Generous amounts of gold thread are incorporated into the scene. Despite the discovery of gold deposits in Europe in the later Middle Ages, West African gold continued to be highly prized for its quality and purity. A mid-17th-century shipwreck offers compelling evidence for the export of West African gold to England. The ship sank off the coast of Devon, England, carrying scraps of gold jewelry, ingots, and more than 400 gold coins, most of them minted in Morocco between the 11th and 17th centuries.",

The discovery of a bead workshop producing high-lime and high-aluminium beads 389 kilometers southeast at a site called Igbo Olokun, within the city of Ife, supports the hypothesis that these unique beads were made and exchanged locally. Yet, of the 165,000 stone and glass beads found at Igbo Ukwu, many are also traceable to the Mediterranean, the Levant, the Middle East, Arabia, and India.

It is possible that horses were imported, at great expense, along routes of exchange with the Western Sudan and North Africa. Another possibility is that another object representing a horse and rider was imported, inspiring an artist to make this ornament.

Every Friday it was taken to the Niger River to be ritually bathed with sand and water, accompanied by chants in Yoruba, a language associated with the city of Ife. During the medieval period, Tada's location would have been of strategic importance to Ife, connecting it with long-distance trade. Analysis of the raw copper from which the statue is made suggests that it might have originated in France, traveling along these very trade routes to Ife, where it was cast.",

The exchange of copper transported southward across the Sahara for gold is described in the mid-tenth century by ‘Ishāq Ibn al-Ḥusayn’: \"Their country (the Sudan) has much gold, but the people there prefer brass to gold.\" The origins of the metals alloyed to make these ingots is not clear. However, a preliminary isotopic analysis of the ingots and the copper-alloy objects cast in Durbi Takusheyi suggests possible sources in France, the Iberian Peninsula, and the Middle East. Thin rod-shaped copper ingots dated between the 11th and 13th century were found at Ma’den Ifajen, Mauretania and at Natamatao, Mali. Recent excavations at Tamdult, Morocco, by a Moroccan/UK team (Institut National des Sciences de l’Archéologie et du Patrimoine/British Museum) have recorded fragments of moulds that would have produced ingots with a similar form to those excavated at Durbi Takusheyi.",

The bowl's profile and the placement of its surface decoration are almost identical to Mamluk period Arabic-inscribed bowls; however, details such as the use of a pseudo script— an attempt by an artist unfamiliar with Arabic to capture the formal essence of Arabic calligraphy—and the representation of stylized crocodiles and mudfish, inhabitants of the Akan forest, in two of the eight medallions, show how a local artist may have reinterpreted important visual elements.",

For instance, the Akan system for weighing gold was based on the mithqal, a unit of weight equal to 4.5 grams (0.16 ounce). The Akan gold economy gave rise to an array of striking new objects for measuring gold: scoops, spoons, boxes, and especially copper-alloy weights in a great variety of forms, some of which also reference the geometric designs of the Muslim Saharan world.",

    "description": "Vast amounts of unglazed ceramic fragments —the remains of bottles, bowls, jars, storage containers, and other items essential to daily life—have been excavated at multiple sites in the Western Sudan region, and even north of the Sahara at sites including Sijilmasa. Decorated with imprinted roulette patterns or slip-painted motifs, these vessels were used domestically for cooking and food storage. Such terracotta containers also transported commodities including grains and fist from Mali’s fertile Inland Niger Delta across vast distances.",

    "description": "The slightly arcing shapes of these small tubes of green glass, excavated at Essouk-Tadmekka, Mali, suggest they were likely part of small spouted bottles. Made in Egypt or western Asia, such bottles were used throughout the medieval Mediterranean as containers for perfume or rose water. Fragments of glass vessels have also been found at other medieval sites north and south of the Sahara Desert, material remnants of the long-distance trade of luxury glassware.",

    "description": "This fragment of porcelain excavated at Tadmekka is a sherd of ceramic ware that expands the exhibition’s conception of the Trans Saharan trade scale. The light green piece of celadon-glazed porcelain was originally part of a shallow bowl made in the Song dynasty in Southeastern Jiangxi Province, China. Fragments of Qingbai ware have been found at medieval sites across the Sahara, Asia, and Egypt. The global dispersion of Qingbai ware fragments is a representation of the pervasive impact of long term exchange. Archaeologist Timothy Insoll, who excavated at Gao Ancien (Mali) and other West African sites, states, “Commerce meant interaction; no matter how strictly one might attempt to control this, trade meant the flow of ideas, and once again complexity is evident and must be allowed for.\" The Qingbai fragment becomes one of the exhibition's fragments that helps ground the imagination as a tool for navigating the Trans Saharan trade.",
