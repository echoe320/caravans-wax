    "label": "Vast amounts of unglazed ceramic fragments— the remains of bottles, bowls, jars, storage containers, and other items essential to daily life—have been excavated at multiple sites in the Western Sudan region, and even north of the Sahara at sites including Sijilmasa. This distribution across sites from the Inland Niger Delta to the Northern Sahara has led archaeologists to speculate that ceramic containers were used to carry goods, such as shea butter or honey, short and long distances in trade. They are decorated with imprinted roulette patterns or slip-painted motifs. Some of the fragments are predicted to have been parts of containers for products like shea butter and honey. Because of their distribution across sites from the Inland Niger Delta to the Northern Sahara archaeologists speculate that ceramic containers were used to carry goods, such as shea butter or honey, short and long distances in trade.",

Ivory was among the commodities traded across the desert in the Medieval period. With a 16.5 centimeter diameter at its most wide, the statuette could only have been carved from the tusk of an African Savanna elephant. Thus, it speaks directly to the distance and importance of trans-Saharan trade for European Medieval art. The piece has both West African material in the ivory and European iconography. This juxtaposition sheds light on the importance of trans-Saharan trade for Europe in the Global Medieval period.",

    "label": "Eleventh century Andalusian historian and geographer Abu ‘Ubayd al-Bakri references the gold currency found of the Saharan entrepôt of Tadmekka, “of all the towns in the world, [Tadmekka] is the one that resembles Mecca the most… Their dinars are called ‘bald’ because they are of pure gold without any stamp.” With little pre-existing accounts of West African coinage, this account had been considered fictional. Most currency production was attributed to north of the Sahara. The 2005 excavations at Tadmekka uncovered the very terracotta fragments with cup-like indentations that substantiates Al-Bakri’s account. The three small circular pieces immediately suggest their original function as molds. Subsequent examinations and research not only concluded that these forms relate to known traditions of coin production, but also detected small droplets of gold adhered to one of the indentations. Working with the archaeologist who recovered the mold fragments, material scientists from Northwestern University have tested a process for purifying and casting gold using the same material resources available at Tadmekka. Gold dust was melted and filtered through crushed glass to purify it. Copies of the mold fragments were then used by the scientists to cast replica blank dinars in bronze. Using the domestic ceramic fabric found at Tadmekka, the molds differ in their superficial vitrification from the high-temperature firing process.",

Analysis of copperwork from Igbo Ukwu suggests that metal casters there supplemented locally sourced copper with copper from mines in Tunisian or Moroccan. Igbo Ukwu had local metal to use but most other regions did not which made copper very valuable. In 1324, Cairene author al-‘Umarī wrote that copper sold for two-thirds its weight in gold. But sub-Saharan trade still affected Igbo Ukwu. Local production of copper was severely affected by the increased presence of brass imported from across the Sahara by Arab traders from the eleventh and twelfth centuries (Craddock et. al., 426). The raised ropes and dots reference the beads found at Igbo Ukwu, which circulated internally and abroad. Attached at the copper-alloy pendant are yellow glass beads strung on copper wires. Yellow beads do not have the high-lime, high-aluminum content common between the blue beads of Igbo Ukwu and the production site of Igbo-Olkon.",

Tuareg nobility depended on a worker class to tend its flocks, a slave class to meet its domestic needs, and an artisan class to produce leather, wood, and metal goods, like this very saddle. Tuareg artisans make camel saddles by covering a wooden core with dyed leather. Then, they decorate the pommel and other parts of the saddle with metal embellishments filled with geometric patterns, similar to those found in Tuareg jewelry of the same period (desired comparative image). Ornate saddles like this one would probably not be used for lengthy travel, but, rather, for special occasions.  Until the widespread adoption of the camel in the early centuries of the Common Era, historians believe that trans-Saharan trade and exchange was quite rare. Camels are ideal for Saharan movement for their endurance: they rarely sweat, even in hot desert climates, and can conserve fluids for long periods of time.",
