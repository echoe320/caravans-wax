label: These scoops, spoons, boxes, and gold weight from the eighteenth and late nineteenth
  century are tools for weighing and exchanging gold. They show the movement of gold
  trade from the Sahara to the Atlantic coast starting around the late fifteenth century.
  While made to measure gold, they are not made of gold themselves. These copper alloy
  gold weights originate from Akan speaking regions of today’s Sudan where gold was
  weighed using the mithqal, a unit that equals 4.5 grams. Wangara merchants from
  the Sahara most likely introduced the Islamic world measurement. Unlike other West
  African societies, Akan culture used gold for internal transactions such as food,
  taxes, and marriage settlements. These objects serve the actual gold processing
  as well as symbolically display the value of gold in the Atlantic trade with their
  geometric designs and figurative representations that transcend daily use. Such
  designs perhaps allude to Islamic world of the Sahara.
