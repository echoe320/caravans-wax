label: This inscribed vase is from the 11th century and was found near the remains
  of a mosque in Sijilmasa, Morocco. It is one of the best preserved ceramic objects
  excavated from the site. It is a piece of evidence of the influence of medieval
  Islam on the Sahara on everyday life. The glazed vase has an inscription that reads
  “al-Baraka” (the blessing), with “Allah” (God) or “al-yawman” (prosperity). Many
  other unglazed ceramics and fragments, such as remains of jugs, lamps, storage containers,
  and bowls, have been excavated throughout the Sahara, including many from Egypt
  and other parts of the Middle East as well as China.
