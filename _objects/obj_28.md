label: In 1252, the city-state of Florence adopted the gold standard and began minting
  its own currency. This adoption was supported by an influx of gold from West Africa
  via trans-Saharan trade routes. Florins were stamped with a fleur-de-lis on one
  side and an image of John the Baptist, the patron saint of the city of Florence,
  Italy on the other. A mintmark appears above John the Baptist’s right hand, indicating
  where the coin was produced. Florins could also be hammered out to form valuable
  gold leaf, which was used to embellish objects including religious paintings.
