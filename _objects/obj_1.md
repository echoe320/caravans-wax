label: 'Riding on camelback, the Tuareg once controlled the caravan routes that stretched
  across the Sahara. Their economy was based on herding and supplemented by the trade
  of salt. Tuareg nobility depended on a worker class to tend its flocks, a slave
  class to meet its domestic needs, and an artisan class to produce leather, wood,
  and metal goods, like this very saddle. Tuareg artisans make camel saddles by covering
  a wooden core with dyed leather. Then, they decorate the pommel and other parts
  of the saddle with metal embellishments filled with geometric patterns, similar
  to those found in Tuareg jewelry of the same period (desired comparative image).
  Ornate saddles like this one would probably not be used for lengthy travel, but,
  rather, for special occasions.  Until the widespread adoption of the camel in the
  early centuries of the Common Era, historians believe that trans-Saharan trade and
  exchange was quite rare. Camels are ideal for Saharan movement for their endurance:
  they rarely sweat, even in hot desert climates, and can conserve fluids for long
  periods of time.'
