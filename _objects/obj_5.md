label: This gold ring was excavated at Sijilmasa, Morocco. Found in the lowest levels
  of excavations, which date to the ninth or tenth century, it is one of only a few
  gold objects from the Sahara region to have survived from the time period. It is
  a piece of lasting evidence of the gold trade in the Sahara. A goldsmith made the
  ring through fusing gold into flattening wire arranged in an undulating pattern.
  Dated to an extended period of growth of Sijilmasa by Amazigh (Berber) rulers, the
  craftsmanship of the ring is similar to that of Amazigh jewelry of the 19th and
  20th century from the Sahara and Anti Atlas mountains, possibly indicating this
  ring was made by their medieval ancestors.
