label: The English used the motif on these coins, an small elephant-and-castle below
  a large bust of English King James the II, to signify that the coin was made from
  West African gold. More specifically, the motif indicates that The Royal Africa
  Company obtained this gold. The Royal Africa Company gained a monopoly over gold
  trade to in 1872 from the British crown. Although trade had shifted away from the
  Sahara at this time, this coin highlights gold and ivoryâ€™s continuing importance.
  The Royal Africa Company exported not just gold but primarily slaves. Leaving from
  Bristol, Liverpool and London, the company sailed from Cape Salle (present day Morocco)
  to the Cape of Good Hope (in South Africa) transporting around 5,000 slaves per
  year from 1680 to 1686.
