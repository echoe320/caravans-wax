label: This casket was fashioned from African Savanna Elephant ivory in Sicily, a
  Mediterranean island off the coast of southern Italy. It includes gold leaf, likely
  the product of trans-Saharan trade. The use of gold, as well as the delicate ornamental
  motifs, suggest the casket once held something of substantial value. Written in
  Arabic, an inscription reads “May glory endure.” The Arabic-speaking Muslim population
  to which this casket is attributed maintained their communities even though the
  Normans had recently conquered Sicily in the twelfth century. Norman rule saw a
  unique visual culture flourish and the Muslim communities contributed substantially
  to it, partially, with Siculo-Arabic caskets like this.
