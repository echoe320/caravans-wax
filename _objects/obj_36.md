label: This blue glass armlet was excavated from a royal grave at Igbo Ukwu. Its location
  suggests the prestige of beads and their place in rituals, such as burials. Thurstan
  Shaw, who led excavations at the site, found that the high-lime and high-aluminium
  contents of beads like those in this armlet resemble dark blue and reddish brown
  coated beads in Igbo Ukwu. Their discovery 389 Kilometers southeast of Ile-Ife it
  suggests an internal exchange of beads. Yet, of the 165,000 of stone and glass beads
  found at Igbo Ukwu, a lot of lead and elemental isotopes also link the beads to
  the Mediterranean, the Levant, Middle East, Arabia, and India. The beads offer an
  interesting look into both the local south-north trade and the importance of Igbo
  Ukwu in the larger trans-Saharan network; beads of similar material composition
  were also found at Gao and Tadmekka in Mali. These discoveries establishes that
  significant glass bead production was underway in the forest region at Igbo Olokun,
  and that these beads were part of a global circulation of glass beads.
