label: This bowl was discovered in 1909 while dredging for gold along the banks of
  the Offin River in southern Ghana. Its formal similarity to the Durbi Takusheyi
  brass bowl proves that such bowls were imported as early as the fourteenth or fifteenth
  century. The bowl’s profile and the placement of its surface decoration are almost
  identical to Mamluk period Arabic-inscribed bowls, but details such as the use of
  “pseudo script”— an attempt by an artist unfamiliar with Arabic to capture the formal
  essence of Arabic calligraphy— and the representation of stylized crocodiles and
  mudfish, inhabitants of the Akan forest, in two of the eight medallions, show how
  a local artist has reinterpreted important visual elements.
