label: Excavated at Lafogido, within the medieval city of Ile-Ife in Nigeria, this
  head of an elephant was discovered atop a globular pot. Made of terracotta and just
  over 18.5 cm tall, this elephant head portrays the splendid regalia of the ruling
  elite of Ile-Ife through its headdresses and necklaces, which are embellished with
  beads of different sizes. The association of the powerful elephant with the political
  leaders suggests a statement of authority. In addition, such an association represents
  wealth, since elephant tusks were valuable commodities in the interregional trade
  that followed the Niger River and connected with trans-Saharan routes of exchange.
