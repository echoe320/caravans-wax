label: This small crucible recovered from Gao was used in glass bead making. Glass
  beads, which were produced at many locales and exchanged across vast distances,
  provide a microcosm for considering the complex networks that met at Gao. Approximately
  two-thirds of the beads are from the lower occupation levels, dated to the eighth
  to tenth centuries, with many of those found in trenches in broken, malformed, or
  unfinished condition. The evidence from these trenches is especially compelling,
  suggesting that Gao was a production site for recycling and remaking imported glass.
  Fragments suggest, for instance, that beads were cut from glass canes and then heated
  in order to smooth their edges, and that broken glassware was melted to make beads
  crush them
