label: In Western Europe, Christian artworks were often embellished with gold leaf
  in the medieval period. In this panel painting from Italy, Christ places a crown
  on the head of his mother, Mary, symbolizing her role as Queen of Heaven. Angels
  and other holy figures fill the heavenly space that is conveyed by the golden background.
  Much of the gold used in Italy came from West Africa through trans-Saharan trade
  routes. Beginning in the thirteenth century, Italian city-states, such as Florence
  and Venice, began minting gold coins largely made from West African gold. These
  coins, such as the florin also in this section (LINK to florin), were beaten into
  thin sheets of foil, which were then used as gold leaf. From one coin, craftsmen
  could make more than 100 leaves.
