label: 'In Morocco, the descendants of enslaved people from Mali, Niger, Senegal and
  elsewhere in the Sahelian region of West Africa refer to themselves as Gnawa. The
  Gnawa are known for their spiritual healing practices and for celebratory musical
  performances, both of which incorporate iron cymbals (qraqeb), as well as a guitar-like
  instrument called the guinbri. The processes of making iron cymbals and using them
  in performances is deeply associated with mysticism through the blacksmiths who
  make the cymbals. Blacksmiths are associated with special skills that enable them
  to control fire and spirits. The repetitive sounds of the cymbals is intended to
  mimic the sound chains used to shackle enslaved Africans. '
