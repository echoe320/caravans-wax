label: Many of these stucco fragments decorated architecture around the city. These
  fragments are the remains of a mosque, a citadel, an ore-processing site, and the
  residence where the gold ring was found. Houses and other buildings were decorated
  with painted plaster and wood veneer, sometimes inscribed with words from the Qur’an.
  The homes usually had wood roofs and plaster floors as well. Excavations reveal
  that the original Sijilmasa mosque was redone to be properly oriented towards Mecca
  in about 1148 AD.
