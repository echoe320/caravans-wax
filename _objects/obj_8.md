label: This fragment of porcelain excavated at Tadmekka is a sherd of ceramic ware
  that expands the exhibition’s conception of the Trans Saharan trade scale. The light
  green piece of celadon-glazed porcelain was originally part of a shallow bowl made
  in the Song dynasty in Southeastern Jiangxi Province, China. Fragments of Qingbai
  ware have been found at medieval sites across the Sahara, Asia, and Egypt. The global
  dispersion of Qingbai ware fragments is a representation of the pervasive impact
  of long term exchange. Archaeologist Timothy Insoll, who excavated at Gao Ancien
  (Mali) and other West African sites, states, “Commerce meant interaction; no matter
  how strictly one might attempt to control this, trade meant the flow of ideas, and
  once again complexity is evident and must be allowed for.” The Qingbai fragment
  becomes one of the exhibition’s fragments that helps ground the imagination as a
  tool for navigating the Trans Saharan trade.
