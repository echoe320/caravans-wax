label: This large seated figure (about 54 cm tall) in naturalist style is hollow-cast
  in almost pure copper (with traces of arsenic, lead, and tin). It was found at Tada,
  a small village on the banks of the Niger River in Nigeria. In the late nineteenth
  and early twentieth century, the figure was still part of the ritual life of Tada.
  Every Friday it was taken to the Niger River to be ritually bathed with sand and
  water, accompanied by chants in Yoruba, a language associated with the city of Ife.
  Its casting style and the fact that it wears a wrapper with a sash tied on its left
  hip (which is characteristic of Ife culture), further associates the figure with
  Ile-Ife during the late thirteenth to fourteenth century. Ife was the capital of
  a powerful state 120 miles south of Tada. In the medieval period, Tada’s location
  would have been of strategic importance to Ife, connecting it with long-distance
  trade. As an indication, analysis of the raw copper from which the statue is made
  suggests that it might have originated in France, traveling along these very trade
  routes to Ife, where it was cast.
