label: During the medieval period, the Arabic language and the Islamic faith spread
  together along trade routes across the Sahara and then gradually across the Western
  Sudan. Few West African manuscripts from the medieval period survive today, and
  the earliest date from the 16th century. However, this 19th century Qur’an written
  in the Hausa language reflects the linked movement of language, faith, and trade.
  The Qur’an has a square format and endpages embellished with interlacing calligraphic
  patterns in colored ink and gold. Rather than a leather binding characteristic of
  medieval period books, it was stored in an easily transportable leather pouch.
