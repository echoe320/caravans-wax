label: This standing figure from the Nok Culture in North-Central Nigeria is one of
  the earliest known terracotta sculptures in excavated from a site in Africa. Dating
  back to the first century, it points to a rich material culture in the Central Sudan
  that existed before the Medieval period. The figure’s beaded necklace and belt suggests
  that beads were already deeply ingrained culturally, and tied to leadership and
  wealth. Excavations in the region also found beads made of colorful stones. Archeologist
  such Peter Breunig and Bernard Fagg imagine the later Ife culture bronze figures
  may have taken inspiration from Nok in their subject matter and style. The Jebba
  Bowman exemplify this.
