label: Diplomat and scholar Leo Africanus, born in Fez, Morocco, published his Description
  of Africa in 1526. The book, composed in Italian, was the first description of Africa
  published in Europe with the aim of educating European and Christian audiences about
  the continentâ€™s geography, people, and resources. Leo traveled widely throughout
  his life, including to Cairo, across the Sahara to Timbuktu, and to Rome. In Rome
  he was imprisoned and, in 1520, baptized by order of Pope Leo X. He spent the following
  years in Roman scholarly circles, learning Italian and teaching Arabic.
