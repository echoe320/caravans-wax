label: 'A total of 293 fragments of imported glass vessels have been recorded at the
  ancient medieval city, Gao Saney. Out of a total of almost eight hundred glass beads
  and fragments, they are blue, blue green, green, or off-white and cylindrical, oval,
  or tubular. Approximately two-thirds of the beads are from lower occupation levels,
  dated to the eighth to tenth centuries in broken, malformed, or unfinished condition.
  The production of glass beads in the medieval took two forms: primary production
  from molten glass and secondary production involving the remeltinging of broken
  glass for bead making. Fragments suggest, for instance, that beads were cut from
  glass canes and then heated in order to smooth their edges, and that broken glassware
  was melted to make beads. Glass beads are recognized as objects of power, affluence,
  ritual, commerce, and social status in many African societies. At local and, to
  some extent, regional levels, the production of glass beads in medieval brought
  about dramatic social, political, and economic transformations: a period of “bleaded
  splendor”. The demand for these glass beads were largely ornamental, though as costly
  items of prestige they would have constituted signs of rank. Glass beads, which
  were produced at many locales and exchanged across vast distances, provide a microcosm
  for considering the complex networks that met at Gao.
