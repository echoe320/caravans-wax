label: This Mamluk bowl made in Egypt or Syria has an Arabic inscription which was
  originally inlaid with silver and gold. It was found in the burial site at Durbi
  Takusheyi (Nigeria) and within it were place five pieces of gold jewelry and the
  burial also contained cowrie shells, and brass and silver armlets. In the Mamluk
  Sultanate, vessels like this were made by specialized metalworkers, the nahassin,
  for the society’s elite who used them as spectacular display pieces and diplomatic
  gifts. This bowl is evidence that Mamluk metalwork was carried across the Sahara
  and circulated in West Africa as early as the fourteenth century. The bowl is very
  similar to Mamluk bowls used on shrines in several towns in Ghana. The burial site
  in Durbi Takusheyi reflects the increase in international and Islamic influences
  in Hausaland beginning during the late fourteenth century. Raw materials or finished
  goods arrived here from Western Sudan as from the east.
