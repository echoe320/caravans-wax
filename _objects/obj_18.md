label: 'This terracotta figure was excavated in the burial ground of Natamatao, alongside
  skeletons of horses and humans. It is part of a widespread local terracotta sculpture
  tradition, stretching from the twelfth to fourteenth centuries, even after the introduction
  of Islam to the region. The depiction of horses was a prevalent theme of terracotta
  figures during the time as horses were crucial livestock. A small breed of horse
  is native to the region, and Arabian horses were also imported from north of the
  Sahara in the medieval period. Located in an advantageous location close to the
  Niger river and full of fertile land, Natamatao was one of the sixty flourishing
  interdependent communities in the delta area. '
