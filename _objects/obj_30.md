label: The page of this Qur’an feature gold and silver script on indigo-colored parchment.
  The use of sumptuous and lavish materials in its pages is uncommon for Arabic manuscripts.
  The Blue Qur’an has been housed in the library of the Great Mosque of Kairouan in
  Tunisia since at least 1294. Today, however, about 100 of its 600 pages are kept
  in collections around the world, sixty seven of which are still in Tunisia. During
  the medieval period, a shared manuscript culture among Muslims, Christians, and
  Jews extended across North Africa, the Middle East, and Europe. Common elements
  in this manuscript tradition included elegant calligraphy; painted embellishments,
  whether figurative illustrations or geometric patterns; gold accents; and decorative
  leather bindings. Gold and leather, both prominently used in bookmaking, were imported
  from West Africa, and book culture likewise spread to West Africa as Islam spread
  across the Sahara Desert.
