label: Eleventh century Andalusian historian and geographer Abu ‘Ubayd al-Bakri references
  the gold currency found of the Saharan entrepôt of Tadmekka, “of all the towns in
  the world, [Tadmekka] is the one that resembles Mecca the most… Their dinars are
  called ‘bald’ because they are of pure gold without any stamp.” With little pre-existing
  accounts of West African coinage, this account had been considered fictional. Most
  currency production was attributed to north of the Sahara. The 2005 excavations
  at Tadmekka uncovered the very terracotta fragments with cup-like indentations that
  substantiates Al-Bakri’s account. The three small circular pieces immediately suggest
  their original function as molds. Subsequent examinations and research not only
  concluded that these forms relate to known traditions of coin production, but also
  detected small droplets of gold adhered to one of the indentations. Working with
  the archaeologist who recovered the mold fragments, material scientists from Northwestern
  University have tested a process for purifying and casting gold using the same material
  resources available at Tadmekka. Gold dust was melted and filtered through crushed
  glass to purify it. Copies of the mold fragments were then used by the scientists
  to cast replica blank dinars in bronze. Using the domestic ceramic fabric found
  at Tadmekka, the molds differ in their superficial vitrification from the high-temperature
  firing process.
