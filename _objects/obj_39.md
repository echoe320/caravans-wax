label: This figure of a man wearing woven or quilted armor and carrying a quiver on
  his back is about 100 centimeters tall. It was found on Jebba Island in the Niger
  River at a critical juncture for north–south and east–west trade routes. The figure
  also wears a large medallion, necklaces, armlets, and anklets strung with cowrie
  shells. These accessories project status and may also be a statement of wealth.
  Cowries from the Indian Ocean were used as currency in parts of medieval West Africa
  and might have been transported overland to Central Nigeria along east–west routes
  or across the Sahara and down the Niger River, before they could serve as an artistic
  reference for the creator of this figure.
