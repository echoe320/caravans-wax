label: In this Tekna headdress, knotted and twisted synthetic hair is decorated with
  colorful beads. Ebony, silver, coral, glass, shells, and semiprecious stones are
  intricately stitched into the hairs. Each bead recalls the travel and exchange of
  these very same materials throughout the decades of the exhibition, exemplifying
  the legacy of the medieval period in more recent times.
