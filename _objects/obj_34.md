label: Generous amounts of gold thread were used in this textile fragment from England
  depicting the Coronation of the Virgin. Gold thread, often made with West African
  gold, was commonly used to embroider luxury textiles. This fragment from an English
  textile from the late 1400s depicts the heavenly coronation of the Virgin Mary,
  a popular religious scene (LINK to triptych Coronation). Gold thread was also woven
  into church vestments and into cloth in looms. Records suggest that most embroidered
  goods were commissioned by wealthy patrons, but most of the objects that survive
  today were used in religious, mainly Catholic, contexts. Although European gold
  deposits were discovered in the Middle Ages, West African gold continued to be prized
  for its quality and purity.
