label: This large textile (255.2 cm long) is covered with Qur’anic verses in tight
  script. The red checkered motifs recall magic squares, arrangements of numbers that
  always amount to the same sum, no matter the direction they are added, and the attached
  amulets often encase small squares of folded paper with sacred writing. These are
  key elements of esoteric Islamic practices, and it is possible that the Qur’anic
  text was recited aloud as it was written. In Sufi Islam the repetition of verses
  from the Qur’an is a form of devotion. Across Senegal, Sufi practitioners apply
  esoteric knowledge of sacred texts to the therapeutic practices of divination, healing,
  and spiritual protection. This textile, from around the turn of the century, was
  likely prepared by a practitioner who lent or rented it to clients as needed.The
  elongated figure may represent a lizard, a spirit, or a stylized rendering of the
  name Muhammad.
