label: Trade across Saharan Africa began well before the eighth century, and the first
  Roman solidus was issued in 312. The Roman solidus coin weighed 4.5 grams and was
  used as a standard for weighing gold throughout the trans-Saharan trade wherever
  Roman coins were used. Roman outposts throughout North Africa helped facilitate
  the fledgling trans-Saharan trade and bring gold and other commodities into the
  Roman world.
