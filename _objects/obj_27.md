label: Derived from the standard of the Roman solidus (LINK to Roman solidus), the
  dinar was an Islamic currency with a common weight of 0.16 ounce. Introduced in
  the seventh century, dinars were minted at sites throughout the Mediterranean coast,
  often using West African gold. A dinar was of significant value, and was primarily
  used only for large expenditures. This dinar was minted at Sijilmasa, Morocco, which
  was one of the most productive mints due to its close proximity to the West African
  gold sources. The inscription on the dinar records the political leadership of Abu
  â€˜Inan Faris, and establishes Sijilmasa as a major center of trade and production.
