label: Excavated from the site of a shrine storehouse at Igbo Ukwu, this pendant of
  a bird between two eggs has a textured surface that highlights Igbo Ukwu’s extraordinary
  metal-working techniques. Analysis of copperwork from Igbo Ukwu suggests that metal
  casters there supplemented locally sourced copper with copper from mines in Tunisian
  or Moroccan. Igbo Ukwu had local metal to use but most other regions did not which
  made copper very valuable. In 1324, Cairene author al-‘Umarī wrote that copper
  sold for two-thirds its weight in gold. But sub-Saharan trade still affected Igbo
  Ukwu. Local production of copper was severely affected by the increased presence
  of brass imported from across the Sahara by Arab traders from the eleventh and twelfth
  centuries (Craddock et. al., 426). The raised ropes and dots reference the beads
  found at Igbo Ukwu, which circulated internally and abroad. Attached at the copper-alloy
  pendant are yellow glass beads strung on copper wires. Yellow beads do not have
  the high-lime, high-aluminum content common between the blue beads of Igbo Ukwu
  and the production site of Igbo-Olkon.
