B.  **TADMEKKA (flourished** **10th--14th century)**

*\[O\]f all the towns in the world \[it\] is the one that resembles Mecca the most ... It is a large town amid mountains and ravines and is better built than Ghana or Gao.*[^11]

---Abu 'Ubayd al-Bakri, ca. 1068

The ruins of Essouk-Tadmekka (also called Tadmekka) lie in northeastern Mali. The town sprawls across nearly 125 acres, with the remains of stone structures that include commercial and residential compounds, caravanserais, mosques, and livestock enclosures. Surrounding these are cemeteries where tombstones bear Arabic inscriptions. Cliffs that overlook the town are carved with inscriptions in Arabic and Tifinagh (the written form of Amazigh) that attest to the site's occupation as early as the tenth century.

The town is located at the desert's southern fringe, where in the medieval period camel caravans arrived from and departed for their respective Saharan journeys. Between 2004 and 2005, archaeologist Sam Nixon partnered with colleagues from Mali's Direction nationale de patrimoine culturel and Institut des Sciences Humaines to undertake the first excavations at the isolated site of Essouk-Tadmekka.[^12] Their findings confirm the descriptions of Tadmekka's occupation as a center of trans-Saharan trade that appear in the work of Al-Bakri and other medieval scholars writing in Arabic.

The slightly arcing shapes of these small tubes of green glass, excavated at Essouk-Tadmekka, Mali, suggest they were likely part of small spouted bottles. Made in Egypt or western Asia, such bottles were used throughout the medieval Mediterranean as containers for perfume or rose water. Material remnants of the long-distance trade of luxury glassware, fragments of glass vessels, such as this example from the Corning Museum, have also been found at other medieval sites north and south of the Sahara Desert.

The commodities and manufactured goods that moved along trans-Saharan trade routes were often destined for markets at astonishing distances from their places of origin. A small fragment of celadon porcelain that was excavated at the site of Essouk-Tadmekka, Mali, is a type known as Qingbai ware. Produced in southeastern China, Qingbai pottery was widely exported between the tenth and twelfth century and was exchanged along routes moving from market to market in a process called relay trade. Fragments of Qingbai ware have been found at medieval sites from Central Asia to Egypt and across the Sahara.

The shape of this fragment suggests that it once formed part of the rim of a bowl. The distinctive damask weave of a small piece of silk, also excavated at Essouk-Tadmekka, proves that it was likewise made by Chinese artisans, though the chain-stitch embroidery in red cotton that runs across it was likely added in Tadmekka as further embellishment to a luxury garment.

Vast amounts of unglazed ceramic fragments---the remains of bottles, bowls, jars, storage containers, and other items essential to daily life---have been excavated at multiple sites in the Western Sudan region and even north of the Sahara at sites including Sijilmasa. Decorated with imprinted roulette patterns or slip-painted motifs, these vessels were used domestically for cooking and food storage. Such terracotta containers also transported commodities including grains and fish from Mali's fertile Inland Niger Delta across vast distances.

C.  **GAO (flourished 8th--13th century)**

*Gao is the greatest of the realms of the Sudan, the most important and most powerful. All other kingdoms obey its king*.[^14]

---Ahmad al-Ya'qubi, ninth century

Strategically positioned beside the Niger River and between the Sahara and the fertile West African Savanna, the city of Gao was an important center for trade in the medieval period. The medieval geographer and historian Abu 'Ubayd al-Bakri (d. 1094) observed that Islam was well-established in Kawkaw, the Arabic name for the kingdom of Gao, in the eleventh century: "the town consists of two towns, one being the residence of the king and the other inhabited by the Muslims."[^15]

Excavations at two sites associated with Gao---Gao-Ancien and Gao Saney---have been conducted by Timothy Insoll, Mamadou Cissé, and a joint team from the Direction nationale du patrimoine culturel and the Museum of Ethnology in Osaka, Japan, among others.[^16] Gao Ancien was the royal capital and residence; Gao Saney, a predominantly Muslim town, lay five miles east. Several tombstones with Arabic inscriptions have been found in a cemetery on the outskirts of Gao Saney. This pattern of twin communities in capitals of chiefdoms or kingdoms where the king was not Muslim was replicated throughout much of West Africa, especially along routes of the caravan trade.

**Crucible, excavated at Gao Saney, Mali, 8th--10th century. Terracotta, maximum width 4.8 cm. Direction nationale du patrimoine culturel, Mali. Photograph by Seydou Camara**

This small crucible recovered from the site of Gao Saney was used in glass bead making. Glass beads, which were produced at many locales and exchanged across vast distances, provide a microcosm for considering the complex networks that met at Gao Saney. Approximately two-thirds of the beads are from the lower occupation levels, dated to the eighth to tenth century, and many of those were found in trenches in broken, malformed, or unfinished condition. The evidence from these trenches is especially compelling, suggesting that Gao Saney was a production site for recycling and remaking imported glass. At Gao Ancien, in contrast, most excavated beads had been finished.

Many hundreds of glass, terracotta, and semi-precious stone beads have been excavated at the sites of Gao Ancien and Gao Saney. Originating from many different sites of production and exchanged across vast distances, they provide a microcosm for considering the complex networks that met at Gao. While terracotta beads were likely produced locally, finished glass beads were imported to Gao from bead-making centers in North Africa, Egypt, Europe, and the West African forest region. The presence of crucibles for melting glass and of malformed beads at Gao Saney suggests that it was a secondary glass bead production site in which broken glass was melted for bead making.

The glass beads at Gao are among the most sought-after remains by looters of the site. Antique glass beads are valuable on local and international markets. Protecting this important cultural heritage is essential. Glass beads provide a compelling case study of local and interregional trade in multiple directions in the medieval period.

Decorative glazed ceramics in a number of distinctive styles were transported across the Sahara, and fragments have been recovered at multiple sites. At left, the large fragment of lusterware (center) and of splashware (right) were excavated at Gao in Mali, as was the piece of carved alabaster (right), which likely came from a source in Egypt or Syria. Lusterware was among the most ingenious innovations of Arab potters, who mixed silver sulfides and copper oxides to create a shiny, metallic sheen on the surface of glazed earthenware bowls, plates, and other utilitarian vessels. The decorative ware, including this example featuring a sprightly hare amid vines in the image at right, was popular in Egypt and greater Syria during the Fatimid period (909--1171). The technique also spread to North Africa and Andalusia, including the cities of Malaga and Valencia. Wide appreciation of lusterware is unsurprising given the pottery's similarities to the shimmering sparkle of gold.

D.  **CONNECTING TRADE TO THE NIGER RIVER**

From its source in the Guinea Highlands, the Niger River moves northeastward into the plains of the Western Sudan. There, between the Niger and its tributary the Bani River, flooding creates a fertile zone called the Inland Niger Delta. Its rich soils gave rise to a thriving regional urbanism by the fourth century. Above the Inland Niger Delta, the Middle Niger region extends along the river's wide arc, with cities on its banks that sit close to the Sahara Desert.

The Niger River was the main east--west throughway in the Western Sudan for transportation and exchange long before the escalation of trans-Saharan trade began in the eighth century. Saharan trade intersected with this lively exchange and contributed to the development of the powerful states of Ghana (seventh--thirteenth century), Mali (thirteenth--sixteenth century), and Songhai (fourteenth--sixteenth century) during the Middle Ages.

Residents of the Inland Niger Delta and the Middle Niger spoke Mande languages similar to those spoken at the sources of gold. This and their advantageous location---between the West African gold fields and the Sahara Desert---enabled them to become important intermediaries in the gold trade.

These terracotta figures of a seated man and horse were found at Natamatao, Mali, alongside skeletons of horses and humans. They are part of a widespread local terracotta sculpture tradition that stretched from the tenth to the fifteenth century.[^18] The Niger River's fertile inland delta supported a thriving urbanism in the Middle Ages that included more than sixty interdependent communities. At Natamatao, excavations unearthed materials associated with trans-Saharan trade, notably a bundle of imported copper ingots. Bracelets and pendants, like those depicted on the kneeling figure, might well have been made of brass, a copper alloy. The depiction of horses likewise points to commerce, as they were traded across the Sahara.

Terracotta figures from sites in regions of the Inland Niger Delta and the Middle Niger have been the focus of substantial looting. Today these figures are among the tangible and intangible cultural heritage that is protected by the 1970 UNESCO convention to prohibit and prevent the illicit import, export, and transfer of cultural property and by the 1997 United States-Mali Cultural Property Agreement. Materials from the Bandiagara Cliffs and, most recently, medieval manuscripts from the region of Timbuktu are also included in the bilateral agreement.

The woven textiles found among burial remains in the caves of the Bandiagara Cliffs east of Mali's Inland Niger Delta are among the oldest surviving textiles from West Africa, with dates beginning in the eleventh century. As such, they provide important evidence for the longevity of weaving and dyeing technologies in the region. Large blanket fragments incorporate patterns shared by the Amazigh and Fulani peoples of the Sahara. The blanket itself is assembled from multiple woven bands, establishing the antiquity of a weaving technology unique to West Africa.

This biconical, or double-cone-shaped, bead made in the late nineteenth or early twentieth century shares the shape of biconical beads from the medieval period. It is likely that the style continued to be produced in the region from the eleventh century onward; however, the beads are not exactly comparable. This later bead was cast in silver and then covered with a thin layer of gold over its surface, a technique called gilding. The surface of the bead is embellished with wire filigree, thin metal strips applied in a pattern, and granulation, small spheres of gold.[^19]

E.  **THE MOVEMENT OF LANGUAGE, PEOPLE, AND IDEAS**

Language and ideas traversed the Sahara along with merchants and their commodities during the medieval period. Most prominently, the Arabic language, both spoken and written, moved across the desert. Using Arabic, West African scholars contributed to a widespread culture that included Islam and its associated intellectual discourse.

During this time, scholars residing north of the Sahara wrote accounts in Arabic that included descriptions of the Saharan region. The literature is challenging to interpret, with authors primarily drawing from second- or third-hand reports. Nonetheless, when viewed in conjunction with the material record, the accounts can provide valuable information.

Importantly, medieval Arabic descriptions reveal facets of Saharan exchange that are not apparent in the archaeological record. This is particularly true of the movements of people, whether merchants, rulers, religious pilgrims, or those who were enslaved. Indeed, slavery is made visible almost uniquely in these written accounts. In the medieval period, enslaved West Africans, predominantly women and children, were first taken to Morocco and then eastward to Egypt, Syria, Iraq, and beyond. Enslaved people made the harrowing trek on foot across the Sahara and many died during the journey.

Arabic literacy traveled across the Sahara along with books, inscribed objects, and religious practices, as an offshoot of trans-Saharan trade. The twelfth-century marble grave monument (left) from the cemetery that lies near the archaeological site of Gao Saney, Mali, is inscribed with a poem inspired by a Qur'anic verse that reads in part, "\... alone, He has no partner, and Muhammed is His servant and His messenger. He lived and died faithful to this religion and will live again if it is God's will---May God have mercy on whomever asks for mercy for him." It is likely one of a pair of stones; the other would have borne the name, title, and dates of a member of Gao's ruling class. The stone is one of five surviving monuments made in Alméria, Spain, and transported across the Sahara Desert for clients in Gao.

Originally a grindstone, the bottom half of an apparatus for processing grain, the other stone (right) was inscribed with Arabic script by a local artisan at some time between the thirteenth and seventeenth century and repurposed as a grave monument at the same cemetery. Its accompanying top stone, used for processing grain in tandem with the grindstone, was likewise inscribed with Arabic script.

During the medieval period, the Arabic language and the Islamic faith spread together along trade routes across the Sahara and then gradually across Africa's Western Sudan region. Few West African manuscripts from the medieval period survive today, and the earliest known date from the sixteenth century. However, the legacy of the movement of Arabic into West Africa is found in books like this *Life of the Prophet* text, which reflects the linked movement of language, faith, and trade. The scholar *Al-qadi* wrote a biography of the Prophet Mohammad with devotional instructions in the twelfth century. This manuscript is likely a later copy produced in North Africa and imported across the Sahara at an unknown time. It is one of about forty thousand manuscripts in the collection of Mali's Institut des hautes études et de recherches islamiques Ahmed Baba, most acquired from private family libraries in centers of Islamic learning across Mali.

This large textile is covered with Qur'anic verses in Arabic script. The elongated figure may represent a lizard, a spirit, or a stylized rendering of the name Muhammad, while the red checkered motifs recall magic squares, arrangements of numbers that always amount to the same sum, no matter the direction they are added.[^20] The attached amulets likely encase small squares of folded paper with sacred writing. Across Senegal, Sufi practitioners apply esoteric knowledge of the Qur'an and other sacred texts to the therapeutic practices of divination, healing, and spiritual protection. The textile may have been lent or rented to clients as needed by the practitioner who created it.

*Description of Africa*, written by the diplomat and scholar Al-Hassan Ibn Muhammad al-Wazzan, also known as Leo Africanus, was first published in 1526. Born in Fez, Morocco, al-Wazzan was captured while on board a ship in the Mediterranean Sea and imprisoned in Rome for nine years by order of the pope. He based his account partly on his own experiences traveling to locations including Cairo and across the Sahara to Timbuktu, which was then part of the Songhai Empire. The book, which was composed in Italian, was the first description of Africa published in Europe for a largely European and Christian readership hungry to know more about the continent's geography, people, and resources. This Latin translation was published in 1556.

F.  **MANSA MUSA'S HAJJ TO MECCA**

![](media/image44.jpeg){width="5.279279308836395in" height="3.3768208661417325in"}

**Based on the account recorded by the scholar Shihab al-'Umari only a decade after Mansa Musa's pilgrimage, the red line traces the route taken by the ruler and his large entourage in 1324--25. Musa, accompanied by a large entourage of courtiers, slaves, and warriors, traveled over 4,000 miles on his journey. After crossing the Sahara Desert, he rested in Cairo, Egypt. On his return he passed through his kingdom's newly conquered territory, which included the important trading center of Gao.**

Mansa Musa, the fourteenth-century ruler of the Mali Empire, was immensely wealthy and powerful. He controlled a territory that included the Bambuk and Bure gold fields, the Sahara Desert's southern fringe, and the upper and middle Niger River. Musa made full use of his empire's strategic location at the crossroads of these major zones of trade.

In 1324 Musa embarked on the hajj, the religious pilgrimage to Mecca that all Muslims are expected to make in their lifetime. It was also an opportunity to forge alliances and to advertise his wealth and power through lavish displays. According to the scholar Shihab al-'Umari, who interviewed residents of Cairo at the time of Musa's visit, "this man flooded Cairo with his benefactions. He left no court emir nor holder of a royal office without the gift of a load of gold \... They spent gold until they depressed its value in Egypt and caused its price to fall."

Al-'Umari describes the sumptuous diplomatic gifts that Musa received during his stay in Cairo:

> The sultan sent to him several complete suits of honor for himself, his courtiers, and all those who had come with him, and saddles and bridled horses for himself and his chief courtiers. His robe of honor consisted of an Alexandrian open-fronted cloak embellished with ... cloth containing much gold thread and miniver fur, bordered with beaver fur and embroidered with metallic thread, along with golden fastenings, a silken skull-cap with caliphal emblems, a gold inlaid belt, a damascened sword, a kerchief \[embroidered\] with pure gold, standards, and two horses saddled and bridled and equipped with decorated mule-type saddles.[^21]

During his sojourn in Cairo, Mansa Musa was received by the sultan al-Nasir al-Din Muhammad, who showered him with gifts including a skullcap with caliphal emblems. The cap undoubtedly resembled this luxurious example from the same time period, which is inscribed "Glory to our lord sultan al-Malik al-Nasir."

The historian and geographer Abu 'Ubayd al-Bakri (d. 1094) provided information about Saharan caravan trade to a readership hungry to learn about faraway trading partners. In his *Book of Routes and Realms*, published in 1063, al-Bakri describes royal succession in Kawkaw, the medieval name for Gao: "When a king ascends the throne, he is handed a signet ring, a sword, and a copy of the Qur'an, which, as they assert, were sent to them by the Commander of the Faithful.

Gold and salt were at the heart of medieval trans-Saharan exchange; together these commodities supported a global economy that defined the Middle Ages.

The traveler and diplomat Ibn Battuta, who wrote an account of his journey across the Sahara Desert in the mid-fourteenth century recounted, "The inhabitants of the Western Sudan use salt for currency as gold and silver are used. They cut it into pieces and use it for their transactions."[^22] The journey across the Sahara Desert was arduous and at times treacherous. A camel caravan's pace is about three miles per hour, and caravans could travel more than 2,500 miles on a trans-Saharan trek. Overcoming the risks that such travel posed---thirst, hunger, even death---required strong motivation.

For merchants traveling southward across the Sahara, the main attraction was West African gold, which was widely admired for its purity and symbolic value. The special qualities of gold---its rarity, its sparkle and reflectiveness, its malleability, and its resistance to tarnish as well as the difficulty of extracting it from the earth---all contributed to its value. Empires across North Africa, the Middle East, and Europe minted gold into coins and used it to make and to embellish luxury objects. West African gold provided rulers and merchants with the means to acquire goods from afar. Rock salt, mined in the heart of the Sahara, was among the most important of these. Salt, which is essential to human life, is scarce in West Africa. Along with these primary commodities other luxury goods also circulated, including ivory, copper, glass vessels, and glass beads.

The Jewish cartographer Abraham Cresques was commissioned by the King of Aragon to produce this lavish map for Charles V, the king of France. It was completed in 1375. The Crown of Aragon, a confederation of powerful territories that included parts of the Iberian Peninsula and islands in the Mediterranean, was well situated to be a commercial powerhouse. The *Catalan Atlas* demonstrates the significant European interest in global commerce and the prominence of West Africa in these networks of exchange. Mansa Musa, the emperor of Mali, is prominently depicted on the second panel seated on a throne and holding a golden orb in one hand. The caption reads: "This Moorish ruler is named Musse Melly \[Mansa Musa\], lord of Guinea. This king is the richest and most distinguished ruler of this whole region on account of the great quantity of gold that is found in his lands."[^23]

The origins of trans-Saharan gold trade likely date to the fourth century CE. Roman outposts in North Africa were well positioned to undertake this trade and to disseminate gold and other commodities into the wider Roman world. The first gold solidus coin, featuring a portrait of the emperor Honorius in profile, was issued by the Roman Empire in 312 and weighed 4.5 grams. The measure and its increments became standard units for weighing gold wherever Roman coins were used, and they continued to be used by Islamic states in North Africa and the Middle East during the Middle Ages. It is possible that this system was also transferred via trans-Saharan trade to West Africa, where it was used in the nineteenth-century gold weights in the Akan region of Ghana.[^24]

**MAP OF MINT LOCATIONS FROM EXHIBITION**

Dinars were struck from West African gold throughout the medieval period. This map shows the locations of mints during the Almoravid Dynasty (ca. 1040--1147). Founded by Sanhaja Imazighen, who originated in the region of present-day southern Mauritania, at its apex the dynasty controlled parts of the Niger River, the Sahara Desert, and the Mediterranean Sea. Almoravid mints produced more gold currency than any other empire in the western Islamic lands. Their coinage was highly valued because it was made from West African gold, which was known for being purer than gold from any other known source. The mint at Sijilmasa, which was closest to the West African gold fields, was one of the most productive.[^25]

**Dinar of Abu Inan Faris (r. 1348--1358), struck at Sijilmasa. Gold, diameter 1.0 cm. Bank al-Maghrib 533341. Photograph by Fouad Mahdaoui**

Derived from the standard of the Roman solidus, the dinar was an Islamic currency with a common weight of 4.5 grams. Introduced in the seventh century, dinars were minted at sites throughout the Mediterranean, often using West African gold. A dinar was of significant value and was primarily used only for large expenditures. This dinar was minted at Sijilmasa, Morocco, which was one of the most productive mints due to its close proximity to the West African gold sources. The inscription on the dinar records the political leadership of Abu 'Inan Faris and establishes Sijilmasa as a major center of trade and production.

In 1252 the city-state of Florence in Italy adopted the gold standard and began minting its own currency. This adoption was supported by an influx of gold from West Africa via trans-Saharan trade routes. Florins were stamped with a fleur-de-lis on one side and an image of John the Baptist, the patron saint of the city of Florence, on the other. A mint mark appears above John the Baptist's right hand, indicating where the coin was produced. Florins could also be hammered out to form valuable gold leaf, which was used to embellish objects including religious paintings.

Medieval Christian artworks were often embellished with gold leaf. In this panel painting from Italy, Christ places a crown on the head of his mother Mary, symbolizing her role as Queen of Heaven. Angels and other holy figures fill the heavenly space that is conveyed by the golden background. Much of the gold used in Italy came from West Africa through trans-Saharan trade routes. Beginning in the thirteenth century, Italian city-states such as Florence and Venice began minting gold coins largely made from West African gold. These coins were beaten into thin sheets of foil, which were then used as gold leaf. From one coin, craftsmen could make more than one hundred leaves.[^26]

**Biconical bead*,* Egypt or Syria, 10th--11th century. Gold, with filigree, granulation, and "rope" wire, length 7.2 cm. Photograph © The Aga Khan Museum, Toronto, AKM610**

The wealthy and powerful Fatimid Caliphate (909--1171), which ruled across North Africa, Egypt, and Syria, was active in Mediterranean, Indian Ocean, and trans-Saharan trade networks. Its rulers vied with the Umayyads of Spain for access to West African gold and for control of major trading cities like Sijilmasa. This large and elaborate Fatimid bead is composed of two filigree cones joined along a central seam, a shape that originates from antiquity. Filigree is a complex technique that is based on the soldering of fine-gauge wires to a base sheet, where goldsmiths twist thin sheets of metal and create a visually compelling decoration.

Biconical beads became dispersed widely across the Mediterranean and the Sahara in the medieval period. Small terracotta beads from Gao, Mali, feature the same double-cone shape, showing evidence of this form's movement.

The page of this sumptuous Qur'an features gold and silver script on indigo-colored parchment. The Blue Qur'an was housed in the library of the Great Mosque of Kairouan in Tunisia from at least 1294. Today more than one hundred of its 600 pages are dispersed in collections around the world and more than sixty are still in Tunisia. Although scholars disagree on the precise origins of this sumptuous book, the use of gold and silver script on parchment colored a deep blue nevertheless signals competition with the expensive purple-dyed manuscripts (from the murex sea snail) also circulating in courts around the Mediterranean basin.[^27]

During the medieval period, a shared manuscript culture among Muslims, Christians, and Jews extended across North Africa, the Middle East, and Europe. Common elements in this manuscript tradition included elegant calligraphy, colorful embellishments including gold, and decorative leather bindings. Gold and leather, both prominently used in bookmaking, were imported from West Africa. Book culture likewise spread to West Africa as Islam spread across the Sahara Desert.

This *siddur*, a Jewish prayer book, reflects a taste for delicate tracery penwork. Key pages are also embellished with gold leaf and watercolor. Gold---much of it coming from West Africa---was an important artistic material across the three of the major Mediterranean faiths of the medieval period: Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. Jewish artisans, who often worked with gold, made significant contributions to art and culture during the Middle Ages, creating works for Jewish, Muslim, and Christian clients.

Ivory tusks were among the luxury commodities traded across the Sahara Desert alongside gold. Two elephant subspecies are found in West Africa: the Savanna elephant, which is the largest of all elephant species, and the forest elephant. The tusks of both elephants were circulated through medieval trans-Saharan trade.[^28]

Large-scale *Virgin and Child* statuettes represent the apex of ivory carving in the medieval period in France, and this sculpture is among the largest. Measuring 16.5 cm in diameter at its widest point, the solid statuette could only have been made from the tusk of a Savanna elephant. The artist has maximized the size of the figures of the Virgin and Child obtained from the large tusk and augmented it further by adding separate ivory pieces to make the throne. This statuette was finished with fine details in paint and gold.

This ivory box, or casket, was made on the island of Sicily, off the southern tip of Italy, not long after the Norman conquest. The Arabic-speaking Muslim population of Sicily was not entirely displaced by the Normans, and these communities---and their commercial connections---contributed significantly to a unique visual culture that flourished under Norman rule. The box is embellished with gold leaf and copper fittings, valuable materials that circulated along with ivory across networks that were central to trans-Saharan trade. An inscription in Arabic reads "May glory endure."

This densely embroidered textile fragment depicting the Coronation of the Virgin, a popular Christian story of the period, was likely once part of a vestment, or ceremonial robe. While documents of the period suggest that luxurious embroidered garments were worn by the elite, the majority of surviving embroideries were made for use in the church.[^29] Generous amounts of gold thread are incorporated into the scene. Despite the discovery of gold deposits in Europe in the later Middle Ages, West African gold continued to be highly prized for its quality and purity. A mid-seventeenth-century shipwreck offers compelling evidence for the export of West African gold to England. The ship sank off the coast of Devon, England, carrying scraps of gold jewelry, ingots, and more than 400 gold coins, most of them minted in Morocco between the eleventh and seventeenth century.

**4. THE LONG REACH OF THE SAHARA**

![](media/image61.jpeg){width="6.5in" height="4.146527777777778in"}

**\
The Niger River was a major thoroughfare for trade from the Sahara into West Africa. Niger River trade connected to land routes through the West African forest and the region known as the Central Sudan. In this section the sites of Igbo Ukwu, Ife, and Durbi Takusheyi are presented as case studies that contribute to understanding the history of medieval West Africa.**

A.  **Igbo Ukwu**

B.  **Ife and Its Orbit**

C.  **Medieval Glass Beads**

D.  **Central Sudan/Durbi Takusheyi**

Beyond the Sahara, trade routes reached into West Africa's rainforest, the Central Sudan, and Europe. In the mid-fourteenth century, the traveler and diplomat Ibn Battuta referenced the reach of the Niger River all the way to the city of Ife in West Africa's forest region, stating, "Then the Niger River descends from Dia to Timbuktu and then to Gao \... then to Ife. Ife is one of the largest countries of the Sudan, and their sultan is one of the greatest sultans."[^30] Archaeological excavations at medieval sites in Nigeria provide material evidence of this reach. The sites of Igbo Ukwu (eighth to twelfth century), Ile-Ife (thirteenth to fourteenth century), and Durbi Takusheyi (fourteenth to fifteenth century) reveal the prominence of copper, ivory, and glass beads among the goods that circulated through long and short distance trade in multiple directions during the medieval period.

Igbo Ukwu lies east of the Niger River in Nigeria's forest region. Copper-alloy sculptures and more than 165,000 glass and carnelian beads excavated at the site suggest self-supporting metal casting and glass production industries that connected with active local and interregional trade networks and supplemented the raw materials for craft production.

Ife, in Central Nigeria, was the political and ritual center of a kingdom that supported a multiethnic regional economy that extended nearly 120 miles northward to the Niger River. Workshops for glassmaking and copper, copper alloy, and terracotta sculptures produced prolific artworks there and at sites within the orbit of the powerful city.

Durbi Takusheyi, in Northern Nigeria, is situated halfway between the Niger River and Lake Chad. It provides some of the earliest documentation for the Hausa kingdoms, which would grow to dominate the region between the sixteenth and the nineteenth century. Excavations at Durbi Takusheyi included burial sites with sumptuous grave goods that attest to global interactions.

This standing figure from the Nok Culture in North-Central Nigeria is one of the oldest known terracotta sculptures to be excavated from a site in Africa.[^31] Dating to the first century CE, it is one of over 1,000 such figures that have been excavated in the region, pointing to a rich material culture in the Central Sudan long before the medieval period. The figure is depicted wearing a beaded necklace and belt, providing evidence that beads were already deeply ingrained culturally and tied to leadership and wealth before medieval trans-Saharan trade increased the availability of glass beads in the region. These are likely semi-precious stone beads, which have been found in abundance at Nok sites.

The corpus of sculptures from Nok, considered the earliest known terracotta sculptures from Africa south of the Sahara Desert, are among the ancient traditions that have been threatened by illegal looting in Western Africa. Protecting these and other examples of tangible and intangible cultural heritage is essential for passing this heritage on to future generations.

A.  **IGBO UKWU** **(8th--early 12th century)**

The town of Igbo Ukwu lies west of the Niger River in Nigeria's forest region. Excavations conducted there unearthed a remarkable group of over 600 prestige objects including extraordinary cast copper-alloy sculptures and more than 165,000 glass and carnelian beads.

Evidence ties wealthy and powerful Igbo Ukwu to global medieval trade networks that extended down the Niger River from the edge of the Sahara Desert. Glass beads provide a telling link: the same types have been found at Igbo Ukwu and at Gao, Mali, in the Western Sudan.

Analysis of cast objects from Igbo Ukwu shows its strong ties to local trade. Most of the copper and alloys---primarily tin, lead, and silver---used to make bronze objects there came from nearby sources. This supports the hypothesis that at its inception Igbo Ukwu's innovative metal casting industry was self-sustaining. Nonetheless, metal analysis also suggests that the production of copper alloys at Igbo Ukwu may have been supplemented by copper from the Sahara, particularly in the second half of its existence.

This blue glass armlet was excavated from a royal grave at Igbo Ukwu. Thurstan Shaw, who led excavations at the site, found that many beads from the site are distinguished by high lime and high aluminum content. The discovery of a bead workshop producing high-lime and high-aluminum beads 389 kilometers southeast at a site called Igbo Olokun, within the city of Ife, supports the hypothesis that these unique beads were made and exchanged locally.[^32] Yet, of the 165,000 stone and glass beads found at Igbo Ukwu, many are also traceable to the Mediterranean, the Levant, the Middle East, Arabia, and India. Beads at the site offer an interesting look into the polity's connections to local and long-distance trade networks, including those crossing the Sahara.

This ornament, which would have crowned a staff or pole, is the earliest known representation of a horse and rider from Africa's central forest region. How the object was made is an open question. Horses cannot survive in the forest for long due to fly-borne disease. It is possible that horses were imported, at great expense, along routes of exchange with the Western Sudan and North Africa. Another possibility is that another object representing a horse and rider was imported, inspiring an artist to make this ornament. The rider is depicted wearing beaded regalia as well as facial scarifications associated today with elite titleholders.

This pendant of a bird perched atop two large eggs was excavated at the site of a shrine storehouse at Igbo Olokun. Its textured surface highlights the artistry and technological skill of the city's bronze-casting workshops. The raised ropes and dots that embellish the pendant evoke the abundant number of beads, also found at Igbo Ukwu, that circulated along local and long-distance trade routes. Many of the copper alloy objects found at the site were designed to be decorated with glass beads; this pendant of a bird and two eggs was found alongside yellow beads and copper wires that attached through loops cast along the object's side.

B.  **IFE AND ITS ORBIT (13th--14th century)**

Ife, in Central Nigeria, was the political and ritual center of a kingdom that supported a multiethnic regional economy. Its reach extended to the Niger River, nearly 120 miles to its north, paving the way for participation in global networks of exchange. Finds at the village of Tada, on the banks of the Niger, and on Jebba Island suggest that they were strategic outposts for Ife, linking the kingdom to north-south and east-west trade routes.

Workshops at Ife produced a corpus of sculptural arts in pure copper, copper alloy, and terracotta. The city was also a center for a prolific glassmaking and glass-bead industry, which was located in the manufacturing quarter called Igbo Olokun.

Though limited in scope, scientific analysis of the copper and copper-alloy sculptures from Ife suggests that the ores were mined in France. Active routes of exchange connected Europe with West Africa at this time. It is possible that copper, in the form of ingots, was transported along these routes to cities in West Africa.

**Museum for African Art and The Fundación Marcelino Botín/ Karin L. Wilis**

The style and the extraordinarily thin casting of this naturalistic figure point to its likely creation at Ife, the royal capital of a powerful kingdom. In the early twentieth century, the figure was part of the ritual life of Tada, a small village on the banks of the Niger River 120 miles north of Ife. Every Friday it was taken to the Niger River to be ritually bathed with sand and water, accompanied by chants in Yoruba, a language associated with the city of Ife. During the medieval period, Tada's location would have been of strategic importance to Ife, connecting it with long-distance trade. Analysis of the raw copper from which the statue is made suggests that it might have originated in France and traveled along these very trade routes to Ife, where it was cast.

This figure of a man wearing woven or quilted armor and carrying a quiver on his back was found on Jebba Island in the Niger River at a critical juncture for north-south and east-west trade routes. The figure also wears a large medallion, necklaces, armlets, and anklets strung with cowrie shells. Cowries from the Indian Ocean were used as currency in parts of medieval West Africa and might have been transported overland to Central Nigeria along east-west routes or across the Sahara and down the Niger River before they could serve as an artistic reference for the creator of this figure.

These stylized terracotta heads of an elephant and a hippopotamus are portrayed in the splendid regalia of the ruling elite of Ife, including headdresses and necklaces embellished with beads of different sizes. The association of these powerful animals with political leaders is almost certainly a statement of authority. Elephant and hippopotamus tusks were valuable commodities in the interregional trade that followed the Niger River and connected with trans-Saharan routes of exchange.

C.  **THE CENTRAL SUDAN AND DURBI TAKUSHEYI (14th--15th century)**

East of the Niger River's arc, the Central Sudan extends to Lake Chad and its vast basin, which has supported settled habitation since the first millennium BCE. As in the Western Sudan, populations in the Central Sudan engaged in trans-Saharan trade during the medieval period. Routes that passed through the region linked Egypt with the Niger River, supporting an economy that was bolstered by trade in multiple directions.

Durbi Takusheyi is situated halfway between the Niger River and Lake Chad in the heart of the Central Sudan. It provides some of the earliest documentation for the Hausa kingdoms, which would grow to dominate the region between the sixteenth and nineteenth century. Excavations at Durbi Takusheyi included burial sites with sumptuous grave goods that attest to global interactions.[^33]

These long brass ingots were buried within an elite grave at Durbi Takusheyi along with other copper-alloy objects made locally and imported from North of the Sahara. Copper was a sought-after commodity in trans-Saharan trade that was mined from sources in the Sahara and in Europe. The exchange of copper transported southward across the Sahara for gold is described in the mid-tenth century by 'Ishāq Ibn al-Ḥusayn': "Their country (the Sudan) has much gold, but the people there prefer brass to gold."[^34] The origins of the metals alloyed to make these ingots is not clear. However, a preliminary isotopic analysis of the ingots and the copper-alloy objects cast in Durbi Takusheyi suggests possible sources in France, the Iberian Peninsula, and the Middle East.[^35] Thin rod-shaped copper ingots dated between the eleventh and thirteenth century were found at Ma'den Ifajen, Mauritania, and at Natamatao, Mali.[^36] Recent excavations at Tamdult, Morocco, by a Moroccan/UK team (Institut National des Sciences de l'Archéologie et du Patrimoine/British Museum) have recorded fragments of molds that would have produced ingots with a similar form to those excavated at Durbi Takusheyi.[^37]

This Mamluk bowl, which was made in Egypt or Syria, was recovered from a burial site at Durbi Takusheyi, Nigeria. The decorative patterns and Arabic inscription that encircle the bowl were originally inlaid with silver and gold; placed within it were five pieces of gold jewelry, possibly imported from the Western Sudan region, as well as cowrie shells and brass and silver armlets. In the Mamluk Sultanate, vessels like this were made by specialized metalworkers, the *nahassin*, for the society's elite who used them as spectacular display pieces and diplomatic gifts. Several Mamluk-period brass bowls have also been preserved at shrines in northern Ghana, to the west of Durbi Takusheyi. These objects are evidence of active trade in luxury wares across the Sahara from the Mamluk Sultanate (1250--1517).

These five pieces of solid gold jewelry were found in a large Mamluk brass bowl from Egypt or Syria, buried beside an individual of high status who also wore ivory, silver, and copper-alloy bracelets, a carnelian necklace, and a richly woven beaded belt. The gold-working techniques manifested in the gold jewelry at Durbi Takusheyi point to trade connections across West Africa. The circular pendant, with its five dome-shaped cabochons, is reminiscent of techniques used to make a pendant known as the Rao Pectoral from Senegal, while the earrings recall tenth-century Amazigh silverwork.

D.  **MEDIEVAL GLASS BEAD PRODUCTION AND TRADE**

The popularity of glass beads in the medieval period is revealed by their abundance in archaeological sites across Africa and throughout the Mediterranean world. Like gold, glass beads were used as currency and as a luxurious embellishment. Small and lightweight, glass beads were easy to transport, and their colorful, shiny appearance made them appealing.

Glass bead production has its roots in antiquity. By the medieval period beads were manufactured throughout the Mediterranean as well as in Europe and in at least one location in West Africa---at Ife in the forest region of Nigeria. Archaeologist Abidemi Babatunde Babalola has led excavations at Igbo Olokun, a site within the medieval city of Ife, since 2010. In 2011 and 2012, Babalola's team recovered over 12,000 glass beads. The beads manufactured at Igbo Olokun have a unique material signature of high aluminum and high lime content. The excavations at Igbo Olokun suggest that millions of beads were made there and exported along routes in all directions. Such beads have been excavated at major Saharan trading centers including Igbo Ukwu in Nigeria and Gao and Tadmekka in Mali.

5.  **SHIFTING AWAY FROM THE SAHARA**

In the late fifteenth century, the establishment of Atlantic-coast trade with Europeans led to a decline in trade across the Sahara Desert. The establishment of trade with Europeans along Africa's Atlantic coast in the late fifteenth century effectively bypassed the series of intermediaries that were essential to Saharan trade. Ships made possible the transport of more goods. Gold, ivory, and other Saharan trade staples remained important commodities, especially in the early days of coastal trade. However, the slave trade would soon dominate the Atlantic economy.

The creation of new trading centers along the West African coast slowed but did not end trans-Saharan trade. As the gold trade shifted southward, it contributed to the creation of the Asante Empire (in today's nation of Ghana). There the legacy of Saharan gold trading continued particularly in the systems of measure based on the *mithqal* (4.5 grams) that were used to weigh gold.

This bowl was discovered in 1909 during dredging for gold along the banks of the Offin River in southern Ghana. Its formal similarity to Mamluk brass bowls and basins of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries that were imported across the Sahara Desert in the late medieval period provides compelling evidence that the making of Akan kuduo was inspired by the north-east African imports.[^39] The bowl's profile and the placement of its surface decoration are almost identical to Mamluk period Arabic-inscribed bowls; however, details such as the use of a pseudo script---an attempt by an artist unfamiliar with Arabic to capture the formal essence of Arabic calligraphy---and the representation of stylized crocodiles and mudfish, inhabitants of the Akan forest, in two of the eight medallions show how a local artist may have reinterpreted important visual elements.

The Dutch and English vied for lucrative trade along Africa's West Coast in the mid-seventeenth century. During this period the English produced guinea coins marked with an elephant-and-castle motif below a bust of the English king, James II. The motif was stamped only onto coins made from West African gold acquired by the newly established Royal Africa Company, which was granted a monopoly on this trade by the British crown in 1672. This iconography illustrates the continuing importance of gold and ivory as commodities, even as trade shifted away from Saharan routes.

In 1992 a shipwreck was discovered off the coast of Devon, England. The ship had sunk in the mid-seventeenth century on its way from North Africa to England. Its cargo included more than 400 gold coins, most of them minted in Morocco in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, as well as gold ingots and jewelry. Mostly worn and broken, these gold objects were on their way to be melted down and repurposed. Today these rare items provide compelling evidence of the export of African gold to Europe.

This ewer, which was made in England in the fourteenth century, was taken by the British from Kumase, the capital of the Asante Kingdom, during the Anglo-Asante War of 1896. It is embellished with heraldic motifs and Lombardic inscriptions. The royal arms of England on the front of the jug reference the reigns of both Edward III and Richard II, but the badges on the lid depicting a stag indicate that it was produced during Richard's reign, specifically between 1390 and 1400. The ewer might have traveled across Saharan trade routes soon after it was made, or it might have been imported to Asante at a later time through trade along the Atlantic coast.
