description: 'Vast amounts of glazed and unglazed ceramic fragments—the remains of bowls, jugs, lamps, storage containers, and other items essential to daily life—have been excavated at sites north and south of the Sahara. This glazed and inscribed vase, from the eleventh century, is one of the best preserved ceramic objects excavated from Sijilmasa. Found west of the remains of Sijilmasa’s grand mosque, the vase bears a decorative inscription reading “al-Baraka” (the blessing) followed by  “Allah” (God) or “al-yawman” (prosperity).'
