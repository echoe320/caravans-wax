description: This gold ring is one of only a few gold objects to have survived from
  medieval Saharan Africa, and it is important material evidence of Sijilmasa’s link
  to Saharan trade. A goldsmith made the ring by soldering thin flattened strips of
  gold in an undulating pattern to upper and lower bands. The ring was found in an
  elite residence and dates to an extended period of development of the city by local
  Amizigh (Berber) rulers, the Bani Midrar. The gold-working technique resembles that
  of 19th- and 20th-century Amizigh (Berber) jewelry from the Sahara and Anti-Atlas
  Mountains.
