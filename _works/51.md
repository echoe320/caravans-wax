description: 'In 1992 a shipwreck was discovered off the coast of Devon, England.
  The ship had sunk in the mid-seventeenth century on its way from North Africa to
  England. Its cargo included more than 400 gold coins, most of them minted in Morocco
  in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, as well as gold ingots and jewelry.
  Mostly worn and broken, these gold objects were on their way to be melted down and
  repurposed. Today these rare items provide compelling evidence of the export of
  African gold to Europe. '
