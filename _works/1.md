description: 'Until the widespread domestication of the camel in the early centuries
  of the Common Era, historians believe, trans-Saharan trade and exchange was quite
  rare. Camels are ideal for Saharan movement: they rarely sweat, even in hot desert
  climates, and can conserve fluids for long periods of time. With camels to ride
  and to carry loads, the Tuareg and other Imazighen peoples of the Sahara once controlled
  the caravan routes that stretched across the desert. Their economy was based on
  herding and supplemented by the trade of salt. Tuareg nobility depended on artisans
  to produce wood, metal, and leather goods like this saddle. This example is too
  ornate to have been used for lengthy travel. It was made by covering a wooden core
  with dyed and tooled leather and then decorating the pommel and other parts with
  metal embellishments filled with geometric patterns. '
