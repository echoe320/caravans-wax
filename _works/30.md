description: Medieval Christian artworks were often embellished with gold leaf. In
  this panel painting from Italy, Christ places a crown on the head of his mother,
  Mary, symbolizing her role as Queen of Heaven. Angels and other holy figures fill
  the heavenly space that is conveyed by the golden background. Much of the gold used
  in Italy came from West Africa through trans-Saharan trade routes. Beginning in
  the 13th century, Italian city-states, such as Florence and Venice, began minting
  gold coins largely made from West African gold. These coins were beaten into thin
  sheets of foil, which were then used as gold leaf. From one coin, craftsmen could
  make more than one hundred leaves. Biconical beads became dispersed widely across
  the Mediterranean and the Sahara in the medieval period. Small terracotta beads
  from Gao, Mali, feature the same double cone shape, showing evidence of this form's
  movement.
