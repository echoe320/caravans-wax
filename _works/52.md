description: This ewer, which was made in England in the fourteenth century, was taken
  by the British from Kumase, the capital of the Asante Kingdom, during the Anglo-Asante
  War of 1896. It is embellished with heraldic motifs and Lombardic inscriptions.
  The royal arms of England on the front of the jug reference the reigns of both Edward
  III and Richard II, but the badges on the lid depicting a stag indicate that it
  was produced during Richard?s reign, specifically between 1390 and 1400. The ewer
  might have traveled across Saharan trade routes soon after it was made, or it might
  have been imported to Asante at a later time through trade along the Atlantic coast.
