description: Arabic literacy traveled across the Sahara along with books, inscribed
  objects, and religious practices, as an offshoot of trans-Saharan trade. This twelfth-century
  marble grave monument from the cemetery that lies near the archaeological site of
  Gao Saney, Mali, is inscribed with a poem inspired by a Qur’anic verse. It is likely
  one of a pair of stones; the other would have borne the name, title, and dates of
  a member of Gao’s ruling class. The stone is one of five surviving monuments made
  in Alméria, Spain, and transported across the Sahara Desert for clients in Gao.
