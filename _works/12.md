description: 'This small crucible recovered from the site of Gao Saney was used in
  glass bead making. Glass beads, which were produced at many locales and exchanged
  across vast distances, provide a microcosm for considering the complex networks
  that met at Gao Saney. Approximately two-thirds of the beads are from the lower
  occupation levels, dated to the eighth to tenth century, and many of those were
  found in trenches in broken, malformed, or unfinished condition. The evidence from
  these trenches is especially compelling, suggesting that Gao Saney was a production
  site for recycling and remaking imported glass. At Gao Ancien, in contrast, most
  excavated beads had been finished. '
