description: 'This terracotta figure of a seated man was found at Natamatao, Mali,
  alongside skeletons of horses and humans. It was part of a widespread local terracotta
  sculpture tradition that stretched from the tenth to the fifteenth century. The
  Niger River?s fertile inland delta supported a thriving urbanism in the Middle Ages
  that included more than sixty interdependent communities. At Natamatao, excavations
  unearthed materials associated with trans-Saharan trade, notably a bundle of imported
  copper ingots. Bracelets and pendants, like those depicted this figure, might well
  have been made of brass, a copper alloy. '
