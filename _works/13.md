description: 'Many hundreds of glass, terracotta, and semi-precious stone beads have
  been excavated at the sites of Gao Ancien and Gao Saney. Originating from many different
  sites of production and exchanged across vast distances, they provide a microcosm
  for considering the complex networks that met at Gao. While terracotta beads were
  likely produced locally, finished glass beads were imported to Gao from bead-making
  centers in North Africa, Egypt, Europe, and the West African forest region. The
  presence of crucibles for melting glass and of malformed beads at Gao Saney suggests
  that it was a secondary glass bead production site in which broken glass was melted
  for bead making.  '
