description: "The page of this sumptuous Qur?an features gold and silver script on
  indigo-colored parchment. The Blue Qur?an was housed in the library of the Great
  Mosque of Kairouan in Tunisia from at least 1294. Today more than one hundred of
  its 600 pages are dispersed in collections around the world and more than sixty
  are still in Tunisia. Although scholars disagree on the precise origins of this
  sumptuous book, the use of gold and silver script on parchment colored a deep blue
  nevertheless signals competition with the expensive purple-dyed manuscripts (from
  the murex sea snail) also circulating in courts around the Mediterranean basin.
  \ \n\nDuring the medieval period, a shared manuscript culture among Muslims, Christians,
  and Jews extended across North Africa, the Middle East, and Europe. Common elements
  in this manuscript tradition included elegant calligraphy, colorful embellishments
  including gold, and decorative leather bindings. Gold and leather, both prominently
  used in bookmaking, were imported from West Africa. Book culture likewise spread
  to West Africa as Islam spread across the Sahara Desert."
