description: This biconical, or double-cone shaped bead, made in the late nineteenth
  or early twentieth century, shares the shape of biconical beads from the Medieval
  period. It is likely that the style continued to be produced in the region from
  the eleventh century onward; however, the beads are not exactly comparable. This
  later bead was cast in silver and then covered with a thin layer of gold over its
  surface, a technique called gilding. The surface of the bead is embellished with
  wire filigree, thin metal strips applied in a pattern, and granulation, small spheres
  of gold.
