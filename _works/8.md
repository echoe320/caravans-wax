description: 'The slightly arcing shapes of small tubes of green glass, excavated
  at Essouk-Tadmekka, Mali, suggest they were likely part of small spouted bottles
  like this example. Made in Egypt or western Asia, such bottles were used throughout
  the medieval Mediterranean as containers for perfume or rose water. Material remnants
  of the long-distance trade of luxury glassware, fragments of glass vessels, have
  also been found at other medieval sites north and south of the Sahara Desert. '
