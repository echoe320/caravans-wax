description: 'The commodities and manufactured goods that moved along trans-Saharan
  trade routes were often destined for markets at astonishing distances from their
  places of origin. Produced in southeastern China, Qingbai pottery was widely exported
  between the tenth and twelfth century and was exchanged along routes moving from
  market to market in a process called relay trade. Fragments of Qingbai ware have
  been found at medieval sites from Central Asia to Egypt and across the Sahara. '
