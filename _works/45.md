description: This Mamluk bowl, which was made in Egypt or Syria, was recovered from
  a burial at Durbi Takusheyi, Nigeria. The decorative patterns and Arabic inscription
  that encircle the bowl were originally inlaid with silver and gold, and placed within
  it were five pieces of gold jewelry, possibly imported from the Western Sudan region,
  as well as cowrie shells, and brass and silver armlets. In the Mamluk Sultanate,
  vessels like this were made by specialized metalworkers, the nahassin, for the society's
  elite who used them as spectacular display pieces and diplomatic gifts. Several
  Mamluk-period brass bowls have also been preserved at shrines in northern Ghana,
  to the west of Durbi Takusheyi. These objects are evidence of active trade in luxury
  wares across the Sahara from the Mamluk Sultantate (1250-1517).
