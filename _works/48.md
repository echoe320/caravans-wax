description: This bowl was discovered in 1909 while dredging for gold along the banks
  of the Offin River in southern Ghana. Its formal similarity to 14th and 15th century
  Mamluk brass bowls and basins that were imported across the Sahara Desert in the
  late medieval period provides compelling evidence that the making of Akan nkuduo
  was inspired by the north-east African imports. The bowl's profile and the placement
  of its surface decoration are almost identical to Mamluk period Arabic-inscribed
  bowls; however, details such as the use of a pseudo script— an attempt by an artist
  unfamiliar with Arabic to capture the formal essence of Arabic calligraphy—and the
  representation of stylized crocodiles and mudfish, inhabitants of the Akan forest,
  in two of the eight medallions, show how a local artist may have reinterpreted important
  visual elements.
