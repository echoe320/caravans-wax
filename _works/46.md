  These five pieces of solid gold jewelry were found in a large Mamluk brass bowl from Egypt or Syria, buried beside an individual of high status who also wore ivory, silver, and copper-alloy bracelets, a carnelian necklace, and a richly woven beaded belt. The gold-working techniques manifested in the gold jewelry at Durbi Takusheyi point to trade connections across West Africa. The circular pendant, with its five dome-shaped cabochons, is reminiscent of techniques used to make a pendant known as the Rao Pectoral from Senegal, while the earrings recall tenth-century Amazigh silverwork.
