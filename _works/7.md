description: The slightly arcing shapes of these small tubes of green glass, excavated
  at Essouk-Tadmekka, Mali, suggest they were likely part of small spouted bottles.
  Made in Egypt or western Asia, such bottles were used throughout the medieval Mediterranean
  as containers for perfume or rose water. Fragments of glass vessels have also been
  found at other medieval sites north and south of the Sahara Desert, material remnants
  of the long-distance trade of luxury glassware.
