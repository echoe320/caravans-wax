description: "\nThe slightly arcing shapes of these small tubes of green glass, excavated
  at Essouk-Tadmekka, Mali, suggest they were likely part of small spouted bottles.
  Made in Egypt or western Asia, such bottles were used throughout the medieval Mediterranean
  as containers for perfume or rose water. Material remnants of the long-distance
  trade of luxury glassware, fragments of glass vessels, have also been found at other
  medieval sites north and south of the Sahara Desert. "
