description: "\nThis figure of a man wearing woven or quilted armor and carrying a
  quiver on his back was found on Jebba Island in the Niger River at a critical juncture
  for north-south and east-west trade routes. The figure also wears a large medallion,
  necklaces, armlets, and anklets strung with cowrie shells. Cowries from the Indian
  Ocean were used as currency in parts of medieval West Africa and might have been
  transported overland to Central Nigeria along east-west routes or across the Sahara
  and down the Niger River before they could serve as an artistic reference for the
  creator of this figure. "
