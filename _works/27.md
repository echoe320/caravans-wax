description: The origins of trans-Saharan gold trade likely date to the fourth century
  CE. Roman outposts in North Africa were well positioned to undertake this trade
  and to disseminate gold and other commodities into the wider Roman world. The first
  gold solidus coin, featuring a portrait of the emperor Honorius in profile, was
  issued by the Roman Empire in 312 and weighed 4.5 grams.  The measure and its increments
  became standard units for weighing gold wherever Roman coins were used, and they
  continued to be used by Islamic states in North Africa and the Middle East during
  the Middle Ages. It is possible that this system was also transferred via trans-Saharan
  trade to West Africa, where it was used in the nineteenth-century gold weights in
  the Akan region of Ghana.
