description: From at least the nineteenth century, the word _gnawa_ has been used in
  Morocco to refer to the descendants of enslaved people from the Western Sudan. The
  term is now associated with black Moroccans who entertain in public squares and
  on concert stages. The _guinbri_ is the most prestigious of all Gnawa musical instruments.
  This drawing of a _guinbri_ is from the account of Danish businessman and diplomat
  Georg Høst of his travels in Morocco. Published in 1779, it is the first known mention
  of a _guinbri_ in European literature. The instrument may derive from one that the
  fourteenth-century Muslim traveler Ibn Battuta described as being played at the
  court of the Mali Empire and that he called the _gunburi_.
