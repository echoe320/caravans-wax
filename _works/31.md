description: The wealthy and powerful Fatimid Caliphate (909–1171), which ruled across
  North Africa, Egypt, and Syria, was active in Mediterranean, Indian Ocean, and trans-Saharan
  trade networks. They vied with the Umayyads of Spain for access to West African
  gold and for control of major trading cities like Sijilmasa. This large and elaborate
  Fatimid bead is composed of two filigree cones joined along a central seam, a shape
  that originates from antiquity. Filigree is a complex technique that is based on
  the soldering of fine gauge wires to a base sheet, where goldsmiths twist thin sheets
  of metal and create a visually compelling decoration.
