description: The Dutch and English vied for lucrative trade along Africa's West Coast
  in the mid-17th century. During this period the English produced guinea coins marked
  with an elephant-and-castle motif below a bust of the English king, James II. The
  motif was stamped only onto coins made from West African gold acquired by the newly
  established Royal Africa Company, which was granted a monopoly on this trade by
  the British crown in 1672. This iconography illustrates the continuing importance
  of gold and ivory as commodities, even as trade shifted away from Saharan routes.
