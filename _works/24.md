description: "\nDuring his sojourn in Cairo, Mansa Musa was received by the sultan
  al-Nasir al-Din Muhammad, who showered him with gifts including a skullcap with
  caliphal emblems. The cap undoubtedly resembled this luxurious example from the
  same time period, which is inscribed ?Glory to our lord sultan al-Malik al-Nasir.? "
