description: Sijilmasa was a sizeable and wealthy urban center in its heyday. The
  Andalusian historian and geographer Abu ‘Ubayd al-Bakri (d. 1094) described the
  city as, “a wall with twelve gates. Within are beautiful houses, many having gardens,
  magnificent public buildings, a mosque that is solidly built, and baths that are
  poorly built." This fragment of painted plaster, bearing an inscription from the
  Qur’an, was found at the site of an elite residence of the 9th or 10th century.
  Just a century or two later of a mosque was built on the same location. The carved
  stucco fragment with geometric patterns was part of the decorative program of the
  mosque during the imperial regimes of the Almoravids or Almohads, both with local
  Amazigh (Berber) origins.
