description: The commodities and manufactured goods that moved along trans-Saharan
  trade routes were often destined for markets at astonishing distances from their
  places of origin. This small fragment of celadon porcelain that was excavated at
  the site of Essouk-Tadmekka, Mali, is a type known as Qingbai ware. Produced in
  southeastern China, Qingbai pottery was widely exported between the tenth and twelfth
  century and was exchanged along routes moving from market to market in a process
  called relay trade. Fragments of Qingbai ware have been found at medieval sites
  from Central Asia to Egypt and across the Sahara. The shape of this fragment suggests
  that it once formed part of the rim of a bowl.
