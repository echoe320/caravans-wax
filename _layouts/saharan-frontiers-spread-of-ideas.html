						  SAHARAN FRONTIERS: The Movement of Language, People, and Ideas
						</textarea>
					</section>

						<textarea data-template>
							Language and ideas traversed the Sahara along with merchants and their commodities during the medieval period. Most prominently, the Arabic language, both spoken and written, moved across the desert. Using Arabic, West African scholars contributed to a widespread culture that included Islam and its associated intellectual discourse.

							During this time, scholars residing north of the Sahara wrote accounts in Arabic that included descriptions of the Saharan region. The literature is challenging to interpret, with authors primarily drawing from second- or third-hand reports. Nonetheless, when viewed in conjunction with the material record, they can provide valuable information.

							Importantly, medieval Arabic descriptions reveal facets of Saharan exchange that are not apparent in the archaeological record. This is particularly true of the movements of people, whether merchants, rulers, religious pilgrims, or the enslaved. Indeed, slavery is made visible almost uniquely in these written accounts. In the medieval period, enslaved West Africans, predominantly women and children, were first taken to Morocco and then eastward to Egypt, Syria, Iraq, and beyond. The enslaved made the harrowing trek on foot across the Sahara and many died during the journey.

							Arabic literacy traveled across the Sahara along with books, inscribed objects, and religious practices, as an offshoot of trans-Saharan trade. This twelfth-century marble grave monument from the cemetery that lies near the archaeological site of Gao Saney, Mali, is inscribed with a poem inspired by a Qur’anic verse. It is likely one of a pair of stones; the other would have borne the name, title, and dates of a member of Gao’s ruling class. The stone is one of five surviving monuments made in Alméria, Spain, and transported across the Sahara Desert for clients in Gao.

							Part of the the relief inscription on this gravestone from Alméria, Spain, reads, “...alone, He has no partner, and Muhammed is His servant and His messenger. He lived and died faithful to this religion and will live again if it is God’s will—May God have mercy on whomever asks for mercy for him.” This stone resembles a group of five 12th-century monuments from Alméria that were discovered in the medieval cemetery near the archaeological sites of Gao Saney and Gao Ancien in Mali. The Gao stones were transported across the Sahara, and it is likely that they were commissioned by Muslim residents of the city.

							During the medieval period, the Arabic language and the Islamic faith spread together along trade routes across the Sahara and then gradually across Africa’s Western Sudan region. Fe West African manuscripts from the medieval period survive today, and the earliest date from the 16th century. However, its legacy is found in books like this 18th century Life of the Prophet text, which reflects the linked movement of language, faith, and trade.

							The scholar Al-qadi wrote a biography of the Prophet Mohammad with devotional instructions in the twelfth century. This is likely a later copy produced in North Africa and imported across the Sahara at an unknown time. It is one of about forty thousand manuscripts in the collection of Mali’s Institut des hautes études et de recherches islamiques Ahmed Baba, most acquired from private family libraries in centers of Islamic learning across Mali.

							This large textile is covered with Qur’anic verses in Arabic script. The elongated figure may represent a lizard, a spirit, or a stylized rendering of the name Muhammad, while the red checkered motifs recall magic squares, arrangements of numbers that always amount to the same sum, no matter the direction they are added.  The attached amulets likely encase small squares of folded paper with sacred writing. Across Senegal, Sufi practitioners apply esoteric knowledge of the Qur’an and other sacred texts to the therapeutic practices of divination, healing, and spiritual protection.  The textile may have been lent or rented it to clients as needed by the practitioner who created it.

							Description of Africa, written by the diplomat and scholar Al-Hassan Ibn Muhammad al-Wazzan, also known as Leo Africanus, was first published in 1526. Born in Fez, Morocco, Al-Wazzan was captured while on board a ship in the Mediterranean Sea and imprisoned in Rome for nine years by order of the pope. He based his account partly on his own experiences travelling to locations including Cairo and across the Sahara to Timbuktu, then part of the Songhai Empire. The book, composed in Italian, was the first description of Africa published in Europe for a largely European and Christian readership hungry to know more about the continent’s geography, people, and resources. This Latin translation was published in 1556.

							MANSA MUSA’S HAJJ TO MECCA

							Mansa Musa, the 14th-century ruler of the Mali Empire, was immensely wealthy and powerful. He controlled a territory that included the Bambuk and Bure gold fields, the Sahara Desert’s southern fringe, and the upper and middle Niger River. Musa made full use of his empire’s strategic location at the crossroads of these major zones of trade.

							In 1324 Musa embarked on the hajj, the religious pilgrimage to Mecca that all Muslims are expected to make in their lifetime. It was also an opportunity to forge alliances and to advertise his wealth and power through lavish displays. According to the scholar Shihab al-‘Umari, who interviewed residents of Cairo at the time of Musa’s visit, “this man flooded Cairo with his benefactions. He left no court emir nor holder of a royal office without the gift of a load of gold. . . . They spent gold until they depressed its value in Egypt and caused its price to fall.”

							Al-‘Umari describes the sumptuous diplomatic gifts that Musa received during his stay in Cairo:

							>The sultan sent to him several complete suits of honor for himself, his courtiers, and all those who had come with him, and saddles and bridled horses for himself and his chief courtiers. His robe of honor consisted of an Alexandrian open-fronted cloak embellished with . . . cloth containing much gold thread and miniver fur, bordered with beaver fur and embroidered with metallic thread, along with golden fastenings, a silken skull-cap with caliphal emblems, a gold inlaid belt, a damascened sword, a kerchief [embroidered] with pure gold, standards, and two horses saddled and bridled and equipped with decorated mule-type saddles.

							During his sojourn in Cairo, Mansa, Musa was received by the sultan al-Nasir al-Din Muhammad, who showered him with gifts including a skullcap with caliphal emblems. The cap undoubtedly resemelbed this luxurious example, which is inscribed “Glory to our lord sultan al-Malik al-Nasir.”

							 The historian and geographer Abu ‘Ubayd al-Bakri (d. 1094) provided information about Saharan caravan trade to a readership hungry to learn about faraway trading partners. In his _Book of Routes and Realms_, published in 1063, al-Bakri describes royal succession in Kawkaw (present-day Gao): “When a king ascends the throne, he is handed a signet ring, a sword, and a copy of the Qur’an, which, as they assert, were sent to them by the Commander of the Faithful. Their king is a Muslim, for they entrust their kingship only to Muslims.” A sword and jewelry were among the diplomatic gifts received by Mansa Musa.
