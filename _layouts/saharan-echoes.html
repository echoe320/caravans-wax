							Echoes of the past can be found in the modern visual culture of the Sahara and West Africa. While archaeological finds, medieval Arabic texts, and oral narratives are important resources for understanding Africa’s past, they tell us little about daily life in the Sahara Desert during the medieval period. In the absence of critical historical sources, it is helpful to turn to more recent material and cultural practices—many of which have enduring connections to the past—to provide a path for imagining the past.

							Until the widespread domestication of the camel in the early centuries of the Common Era, historians believe that trans-Saharan trade and exchange was quite rare. Camels are ideal for Saharan movement: they rarely sweat, even in hot desert climates, and can conserve fluids for long periods of time.  With camels to ride and to carry loads, the Tuareg and other peoples of the Sahara once controlled the caravan routes that stretched across the desert.

							Their economy was based on herding and supplemented by the trade of salt. Tuareg nobility depended on a worker class to tend flocks, a slave class to meet domestic needs, and an artisan class to produce leather, wood, and metal goods, like this saddle.  This saddle is too ornate to have been used for lengthy travel. It was made by covering a wooden core with dyed and tooled leather and then decorating the pommel and other parts with metal embellishments filled with geometric patterns.

							From at least the 19th century, the word gnawa has been used in Morocco to refer to the descendants of enslaved people from the Western Sudan. The term is now associated with black Moroccans who entertain in public squares and on concert stages. The guinbri is the most prestigious of all Gnawa musical instruments. This drawing of a guinbri is from the Danish businessman and diplomat Georg Høst’s account of his travels in Morocco.

							Published in 1779, it is the first known mention of a guinbri in European literature. The instrument may derive from one that the 14th-century Muslim traveler Ibn Battuta described as being played at the court of the Mali Empire, which he called the guinbri.<sup>1</sup>

							The Tekna live in the northwestern part of the Sahara and are descended from local Imazighen (Berbers) and Arabs who immigrated to the region between the 15th and 17th centuries. This Tekna headdress is made of braided and knotted synthetic hair, though in the past the hairs of a horse’s tail would have been used. Horses, as well as the glass, silver, coral, shell, and hardstone beads that are used to the headdress harken back to the medieval circulation of these valued materials, exemplifying how the legacy of the past continues to impact the present.
