description: Part of the relief inscription on this gravestone from Alm‚ria, Spain,
  reads, “...alone, He has no partner, and Muhammed is His servant and His messenger.
  He lived and died faithful to this religion and will live again if it is God's will—May
  God have mercy on whomever asks for mercy for him." This stone resembles a group
  of five 12th-century monuments from Alméria that were discovered in the medieval
  cemetery near the archaeological sites of Gao Saney and Gao Ancien in Mali. The
  Gao stones were transported across the Sahara, and it is likely that they were commissioned
  by Muslim residents of the city.
