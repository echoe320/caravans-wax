description: The page of this sumptuous Qur'an feature gold and silver script on indigo-colored
  parchment. The Blue Qur'an was housed in the library of the Great Mosque of Kairouan
  in Tunisia from at least 1294. Today, more than 100 of its 600 pages are dispersed
  in collections around the world and approximately sixty seven are still in Tunisia.
  Although scholars disagree on the precise origins of this sumptuous book, the use
  of gold and silver script on parchment colored a deep blue nevertheless signals
  competition with the expensive purple-dyed manuscripts (from the murex sea snail)
  also circulating in courts around the Mediterranean basin. During the medieval period,
  a shared manuscript culture among Muslims, Christians, and Jews extended across
  North Africa, the Middle East, and Europe. Common elements in this manuscript tradition
  included elegant calligraphy; colorful embellishments including gold; and decorative
  leather bindings. Gold and leather, both prominently used in bookmaking, were imported
  from West Africa. Book culture likewise spread to West Africa as Islam spread across
  the Sahara Desert.
