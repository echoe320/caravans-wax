description: The style and the extraordinarily thin casting of this naturalistic figure
  point to its likely creation at Ife, the royal capital of a powerful kingdom. In
  the early 20th century, the figure was part of the ritual life of Tada, a small
  village on the banks of the Niger River 120 miles north of Ife. Every Friday it
  was taken to the Niger River to be ritually bathed with sand and water, accompanied
  by chants in Yoruba, a language associated with the city of Ife. During the medieval
  period, Tada?s location would have been of strategic importance to Ife, connecting
  it with long-distance trade. Analysis of the raw copper from which the statue is
  made suggests that it might have originated in France, traveling along these very
  trade routes to Ife, where it was cast.
