description: These terracotta figures of a seated man and horse were found at Natamatao,
  Mali, alongside skeletons of horses and humans. They are part of a widespread local
  terracotta sculpture tradition, stretching from 10th to 15th century. The Niger
  River?s fertile inland delta supported a thriving urbanism in the Middle Ages that
  included more than 60 interdependent communities. At Natamatao, excavations unearthed
  materials associated with trans-Saharan trade, notably a bundle of imported copper
  ingots. Bracelets and pendants, like those depicted on the kneeling figure, might
  well have been made of brass, a copper alloy. The depiction of horses likewise points
  to commerce, as they were traded across the Sahara.
