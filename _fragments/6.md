description: Vast amounts of unglazed ceramic fragments ?the remains of bottles, bowls,
  jars, storage containers, and other items essential to daily life?have been excavated
  at multiple sites in the Western Sudan region, and even north of the Sahara at sites
  including Sijilmasa. Decorated with imprinted roulette patterns or slip-painted
  motifs, these vessels were used domestically for cooking and food storage. Such
