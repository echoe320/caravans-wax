description: Fragments of woven textiles have been found within burials in the caves
  of the Bandiagara Cliffs east of Mali’s Inland Niger Delta. Tellem textiles, named
  after the Tellem people’s occupation of the area, are among the oldest surviving
  textiles from West Africa. Such textiles are typically made of cotton cultivated
  locally and indigo dye, likely imported from north Sahara. They provide important
  evidence for the longevity and widespread use of narrow strip weaving and indigo
  dying technologies unique to West Africa. This large blanket fragment shows the
  creative use of the indigo color, assembled from multiple narrow woven bands.
