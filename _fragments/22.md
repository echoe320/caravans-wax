description: This large textile is covered with Qur?anic verses in Arabic script.
  The elongated figure may represent a lizard, a spirit, or a stylized rendering of
  the name Muhammad, while the red checkered motifs recall magic squares, arrangements
  of numbers that always amount to the same sum, no matter the direction they are
  added. The attached amulets likely encase small squares of folded paper with sacred
  writing. Across Senegal, Sufi practitioners apply esoteric knowledge of the Qur?an
  and other sacred texts to the therapeutic practices of divination, healing, and
  spiritual protection. The textile may have been lent or rented it to clients as
  needed by the practitioner who created it.
