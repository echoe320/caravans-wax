description: The Tekna live in the northwestern part of the Sahara and are descended
  from local Imazighen (Berbers) and Arabs who immigrated to the region between the
  15th and 17th centuries. This Tekna headdress is made of braided and knotted synthetic
  hair, though in the past the hairs of a horse’s tail would have been used. Horses,
  as well as the glass, silver, coral, shell, and hardstone beads that are used to
  the headdress harken back to the medieval circulation of these valued materials,
  exemplifying how the legacy of the past continues to impact the present.
