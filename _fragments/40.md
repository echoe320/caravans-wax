description: 'This pendant of a bird perched atop two large eggs was excavated at
  the site of a shrine storehouse at Igbo Olokun. Its textured surface highlights
  the artistry and technological skill of the city?s bronze casting workshops. The
  raised ropes and dots that embellish the pendant evoke the abundant number of beads
  also found at Igbo Ukwu, which circulated along local and long distance trade routes.
  Many of the copper alloy objects found at the site were designed to be decorated
  with glass beads: this pendant of a bird and two eggs was found alongside yellow
  beads and copper wires that attached through loops cast along the object?s side.'
