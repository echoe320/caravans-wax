description: Derived from the standard of the Roman solidus, the dinar was an Islamic
  currency with a common weight of 0.16 ounce. Introduced in the seventh century,
  dinars were minted at sites throughout the Mediterranean, often using West African
  gold. A dinar was of significant value, and was primarily used only for large expenditures.
  This dinar was minted at Sijilmasa, Morocco, which was one of the most productive
  mints due to its close proximity to the West African gold sources. The inscription
  on the dinar records the political leadership of Abu ‘Inan Faris, and establishes
  Sijilmasa as a major center of trade and production.
