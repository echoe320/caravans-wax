description: 'These long brass ingots were buried within an elite grave at Durbi Takusheyi
  along with other copper alloy objects made locally and imported from North of the
  Sahara. Copper was a sought after commodity in trans-Saharan trade that was mined
  from sources in the Sahara and in Europe. The exchange of copper transported southward
  across the Sahara for gold is described in the mid-tenth century by ?Isha?q Ibn
  al-H?usayn?: ?Their country (the Sudan) has much gold, but the people there prefer
  brass to gold.? The origins of the metals alloyed to make these ingots is not clear.
  However, a preliminary isotopic analysis of the ingots and the copper-alloy objects
  cast in Durbi Takusheyi suggests possible sources in France, the Iberian Peninsula,
  and the Middle East. Thin rod-shaped copper ingots dated between the 11th and 13th
  century were found at Ma?den Ifajen, Mauretania and at Natamatao, Mali. Recent excavations
  at Tamdult, Morocco, by a Moroccan/UK team (Institut National des Sciences de l?Archâ€šologie
  et du Patrimoine/British Museum) have recorded fragments of moulds that would have
  produced ingots with a similar form to those excavated at Durbi Takusheyi.'
