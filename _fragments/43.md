description: Excavated at Lafogido, within the medieval city of Ile-Ife in Nigeria,
  this head of an elephant was discovered atop a globular pot. Made of terracotta
  and just over 18.5 cm tall, this elephant head portrays the splendid regalia of
  the ruling elite of Ile-Ife through its headdresses and necklaces, which are embellished
  with beads of different sizes. The association of the powerful elephant with the
  political leaders suggests a statement of authority. In addition, such an association
  represents wealth, since elephant tusks were valuable commodities in the interregional
  trade that followed the Niger River and connected with trans-Saharan routes of exchange.
