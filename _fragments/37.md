description: This standing figure from the Nok Culture in North-Central Nigeria is
  one of the oldest known terracotta sculptures to be excavated from a site in Africa.
  Dating to the first century CE, it is one of over 1,000 such figures that have been
  excavated in the region, pointing to a rich material culture in the Central Sudan
  long before the medieval period. The figure is depicted wearing a beaded necklace
  and belt, providing evidence that beads were already deeply ingrained culturally
  and tied to leadership and wealth before medieval trans-Saharan trade increased
  the availability of glass beads in the region. These are likely semi-precious stone
  beads, which have been found in abundance at Nok sites.
