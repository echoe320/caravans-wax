description: 'The Jewish cartographer Abraham Cresques was commissioned by the King
  of Aragon to produce this lavish map for Charles V, the king of France. It was completed
  in 1375. The Crown of Aragon, a confederation of powerful territories that included
  parts of the Iberian Peninsula and islands in the Mediterranean, was well situated
  to be a commercial powerhouse. The Catalan Atlas demonstrates the significant European
  interest in global commerce and the prominence of West Africa in these networks
  of exchange. Mansa Musa, the emperor of Mali, is prominently depicted on the second
  panel seated on a throne and holding a golden orb in one hand. The caption reads:
  "This Moorish ruler is named Musse Melly [Mansa Musa], lord of Guinea. This king
  is the richest and most distinguished ruler of this whole region on account of the
  great quantity of gold that is found in his lands."'
