description: 'As European merchants shifted their attention to Africa?s Atlantic coast
  in the late 15th century, the direction of gold trade also shifted. In response,
  new states arose in Africa?s Akan-speaking regions, and aspects of the Saharan gold
  trade were transferred to this new market. For instance, the Akan system for weighing
  gold was based on the mithqal, a unit of weight equal to 4.5 grams (0.16 ounce).
  The Akan gold economy gave rise to an array of striking new objects for measuring
  gold: scoops, spoons, boxes, and especially copper-alloy weights in a great variety
  of forms, some of which also reference the geometric designs of the Muslim Saharan
  world.'
