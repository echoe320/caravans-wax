description: These five pieces of solid gold jewelry were found in a large Mamluk
  brass bowl from Egypt or Syria, buried beside an individual of high status who also
  wore ivory, silver, and copper-alloy bracelets; a carnelian necklace; and a richly
  woven beaded belt. The goldworking techniques manifested in the gold jewelry at
  Durbi Takusheyi point to trade connections across West Africa. The circular pendant,
  with its five dome-shaped cabochons, is reminiscent of techniques used to make a
  pendant known as the Rao Pectoral from Senegal, while the earrings recall 19th century
  Amazigh silverwork.
