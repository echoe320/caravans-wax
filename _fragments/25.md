description: >-
  The historian and geographer Abu â€˜Ubayd al-Bakri (d. 1094) provided
  information about Saharan caravan trade to a readership hungry to learn about faraway
  trading partners. In his Book of Routes and Realms, published in 1063, al-Bakri
  describes royal succession in Kawkaw (present-day Gao): "When a king ascends the
  throne, he is handed a signet ring, a sword, and a copy of the Qur'an, which, as
  they assert, were sent to them by the Commander of the Faithful. Their king is a
  Muslim, for they entrust their kingship only to Muslims." A sword and jewelry were
  among the diplomatic gifts received by Mansa Musa.
