description: "Until the widespread domestication of the camel in the early centuries
  of the Common Era, historians believe that trans-Saharan trade and exchange was
  quite rare. Camels are ideal for Saharan movement: they rarely sweat, even in hot
  desert climates, and can conserve fluids for long periods of time. With camels to
  ride and to carry loads, the Tuareg and other peoples of the Sahara once controlled
  the caravan routes that stretched across the desert. \n \n Their economy was based
  on herding and supplemented by the trade of salt. Tuareg nobility depended on a
  worker class to tend flocks, a slave class to meet domestic needs, and an artisan
  class to produce leather, wood, and metal goods, like this saddle. This saddle is
  too ornate to have been used for lengthy travel. It was made by covering a wooden
  core with dyed and tooled leather and then decorating the pommel and other parts
  with metal embellishments filled with geometric patterns."
