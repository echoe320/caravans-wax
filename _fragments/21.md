description: During the medieval period, the Arabic language and the Islamic faith
  spread together along trade routes across the Sahara and then gradually across Africa?s
  Western Sudan region. Fe West African manuscripts from the medieval period survive
  today, and the earliest date from the 16th century. However, its legacy is found
  in books like this 18th century Life of the Prophet text, which reflects the linked
  movement of language, faith, and trade. The scholar Al-qadi wrote a biography of
  the Prophet Mohammad with devotional instructions in the twelfth century. This is
  likely a later copy produced in North Africa and imported across the Sahara at an
  unknown time. It is one of about forty thousand manuscripts in the collection of
  Mali?s Institut des hautes ‚tudes et de recherches islamiques Ahmed Baba, most acquired
  from private family libraries in centers of Islamic learning across Mali.
