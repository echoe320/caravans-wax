description: The origins of trans-Saharan gold trade likely date to the 4th century
  CE. Roman outposts in North Africa were well positioned to undertake this trade
  and to disseminate gold and other commodities into the wider Roman world. The first
  gold solidus coin, featuring a portrait of the emperor Honorius in profile, was
  issued by the Roman Empire in 312 and weighed 4.5 grams (0.16 ounce). The measure
  and its increments became standard units for weighing gold wherever Roman coins
  were used, and they continued to be used by Islamic states in North Africa and the
  Middle East during the Middle Ages. It is possible that this system was also transferred
  via trans-Saharan trade to West Africa, where it was used in the nineteenth-century
  gold weights in the Akan region of Ghana.
