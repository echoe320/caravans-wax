description: From at least the 19th century, the word gnawa has been used in Morocco
  to refer to the descendants of enslaved people from the Western Sudan. The term
  is now associated with black Moroccans who entertain in public squares and on concert
  stages. The guinbri is the most prestigious of all Gnawa musical instruments. This
  drawing of a guinbri is from the Danish businessman and diplomat Georg H?st?s account
  of his travels in Morocco. Published in 1779, it is the first known mention of a
  guinbri in European literature. The instrument may derive from one that the 14th-century
  Muslim traveler Ibn Battuta described as being played at the court of the Mali Empire,
  which he called the guinbri.
