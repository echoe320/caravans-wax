description: This ornament, which would have crowned a staff or pole, is the earliest
  known representation of a horse and rider from Africa?s central forest region. How
  the object was made is an open question. Horses cannot survive in the forest for
  long due to fly-borne disease. It is possible that horses were imported, at great
  expense, along routes of exchange with the Western Sudan and North Africa. Another
  possibility is that another object representing a horse and rider was imported,
  inspiring an artist to make this ornament. The rider is depicted wearing beaded
  regalia as well as facial scarifications associated today with elite titleholders.
