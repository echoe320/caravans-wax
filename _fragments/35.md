description: This ivory box, or casket, was made on the island of Sicily, off the
  southern tip of Italy, not long after the Norman conquest. The Arabic-speaking Muslim
  population of Sicily was not entirely displaced by the Normans, and these communities?and
  their commercial connections? contributed significantly to a unique visual culture
  that flourished under Norman rule. The box is embellished with gold leaf and copper
  fittings, valuable materials that circulated along with ivory across networks that
  were central to trans-Saharan trade. An inscription in Arabic reads ?May glory endure.?
