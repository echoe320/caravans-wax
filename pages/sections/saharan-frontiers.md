      <p>Riding on camelback, the Tuareg once controlled the caravan routes that stretched
        across the Sahara. Their economy was based on herding and supplemented by the trade
        of salt. Tuareg nobility depended on a worker class to tend its flocks, a slave
        class to meet its domestic needs, and an artisan class to produce leather, wood,
        and metal goods, like this very saddle. Tuareg artisans make camel saddles by covering
        a wooden core with dyed leather. Then, they decorate the pommel and other parts
        of the saddle with metal embellishments filled with geometric patterns, similar
        to those found in Tuareg jewelry of the same period (desired comparative image).
        Ornate saddles like this one would probably not be used for lengthy travel, but,
        rather, for special occasions.  Until the widespread adoption of the camel in the
        early centuries of the Common Era, historians believe that trans-Saharan trade and
        exchange was quite rare. Camels are ideal for Saharan movement for their endurance:
        they rarely sweat, even in hot desert climates, and can conserve fluids for long
        periods of time.</p>

Ebony, silver, coral, glass, shells, and semiprecious stones are intricately stitched into the hairs. Each bead recalls the travel and exchange of these very same materials throughout the decades of the exhibition, exemplifying the legacy of the medieval period in more recent times.</p>

      <h4>De totius Africae descriptio</h4>
      <p>Diplomat and scholar Leo Africanus, born in Fez, Morocco, published his Description
        of Africa in 1526. The book, composed in Italian, was the first description of Africa
        published in Europe with the aim of educating European and Christian audiences about
        the continent’s geography, people, and resources. Leo traveled widely throughout
        his life, including to Cairo, across the Sahara to Timbuktu, and to Rome. In Rome
        he was imprisoned and, in 1520, baptized by order of Pope Leo X. He spent the following
        years in Roman scholarly circles, learning Italian and teaching Arabic.</p>

      <h3>Mamluk bowl</h3>
      <p>This Mamluk bowl made in Egypt or Syria has an Arabic inscription which was
        originally inlaid with silver and gold. It was found in the burial site at Durbi
        Takusheyi (Nigeria) and within it were place five pieces of gold jewelry and the
        burial also contained cowrie shells, and brass and silver armlets. In the Mamluk
        Sultanate, vessels like this were made by specialized metalworkers, the nahassin,
        for the society’s elite who used them as spectacular display pieces and diplomatic
        gifts. This bowl is evidence that Mamluk metalwork was carried across the Sahara
        and circulated in West Africa as early as the fourteenth century. The bowl is very
        similar to Mamluk bowls used on shrines in several towns in Ghana. The burial site
        in Durbi Takusheyi reflects the increase in international and Islamic influences
        in Hausaland beginning during the late fourteenth century. Raw materials or finished
        goods arrived here from Western Sudan as from the east.</p>
