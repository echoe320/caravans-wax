caption: 'Routes across the vast Sahara Desert (that comprises more than 3.5 million square miles) follow paths through a varied terrain, moving between oasesâ€”the underground sources of water that are critical to the survival of travelers. The main routes across the Sahara were established by the fifth century CE, and most continue to be used today. In this section the sites of Sijilmasa, Tadmekka, and Gao are presented as case studies that reveal the history of medieval West Africa.'
