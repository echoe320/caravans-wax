description: 'This pendant of a bird perched atop two large eggs was excavated at the site of a shrine storehouse at Igbo Olokun. Its textured surface highlights the artistry and technological skill of the city’s bronze-casting workshops. The raised ropes and dots that embellish the pendant evoke the abundant number of beads, also found at Igbo Ukwu, that circulated along local and long-distance trade routes. Many of the copper alloy objects found at the site were designed to be decorated with glass beads; this pendant of a bird and two eggs was found alongside yellow beads and copper wires that attached through loops cast along the object’s side.'
