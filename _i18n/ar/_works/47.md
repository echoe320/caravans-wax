description: 'The glass bead assemblage from Igbo Olokun and the other glass-related
  materials discovered there have provided a unique avenue to understanding different
  aspects of glass bead production in medieval West Africa. These include the degree
  of sophistication and expertise of glass bead makers, the scale of production, and
  the transformations it brought to the society locally, regionally, and transregionally.
  Examination of the glass bead assemblage from Igbo Olokun has shown that beads were
  made using the drawing technique in which molten glass is pulled into tubes. '
