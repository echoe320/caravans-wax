description: In 1252, the city-state of Florence, in Italy, adopted the gold standard
  and began minting its own currency. This adoption was supported by an influx of
  gold from West Africa via trans-Saharan trade routes. Florins were stamped with
  a fleur-de-lis on one side and an image of John the Baptist, the patron saint of
  the city of Florence on the other. A mint mark appears above John the Baptist's
  right hand, indicating where the coin was produced. Florins could also be hammered
  out to form valuable gold leaf, which was used to embellish objects including religious
  paintings.
