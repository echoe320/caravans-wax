    title: 'Tour'
    caption: 'During the medieval period, major trade routes crossing the Sahara Desert linked cities and towns that functioned as trade centers. Routes headed south connected with the Niger River, a major byway to Africa’s forest region. Those going north connected to the vast trade networks of the Mediterranean Sea, traveling inland across Europe. Routes headed east met the Levantine routes and ultimately the Silk Roads of Central and East Asia.'

    caption: 'Routes across the vast Sahara Desert (that comprises more than 3.5 million square miles) follow paths through a varied terrain, moving between oases—the underground sources of water that are critical to the survival of travelers. The main routes across the Sahara were established by the fifth century CE, and most continue to be used today. In this section the sites of Sijilmasa, Tadmekka, and Gao are presented as case studies that reveal the history of medieval West Africa.'

While archaeological finds, medieval Arabic texts, and oral narratives are important resources for understanding Africa’s past, they tell us little about daily life in the Sahara Desert during the medieval period. In the absence of critical historical sources, it is helpful to turn to more recent material and cultural practices of Saharan Imazighen peoples—many of which have enduring connections to the past—to provide a path for imagining the past.<sup><a href="/references/">3</a></sup>'

Camels are ideal for Saharan movement: they rarely sweat, even in hot desert climates, and can conserve fluids for long periods of time.<sup><a href="/references/">4</a></sup> With camels to ride and to carry loads, the Tuareg and other Imazighen peoples of the Sahara once controlled the caravan routes that stretched across the desert.'

This Tekna headdress is made of braided and knotted synthetic hair, though in the past the hairs of a horse’s tail would have been used. Horses as well as the glass, silver, coral, shell, and hardstone beads that are used to the headdress harken back to the medieval circulation of these valued materials, exemplifying how the legacy of the past continues to impact the present.'

It lies in the Tafilalt Oasis, a basin of alluvial soils. Sijilmasa was a vital link in the African gold trade. Its mint struck gold coins as early as the tenth century, and evidence strongly suggests that West African gold passed through the area by the fourth century. While much of Sijilmasa was abandoned in the late fourteenth century, parts of the city, such as the great mosque, were used until the turn of the twentieth century.'

      text: '*\[O\]f all the towns in the world \[it\] is the one that resembles Mecca the most ... It is a large town amid mountains and ravines and is better built than Ghana or Gao.*<sup><a href="/references/">11</a></sup>

      &mdash;Abu 'Ubayd al-Bakri, ca. 1068'

      text: 'The ruins of Essouk-Tadmekka (also called Tadmekka) lie in northeastern Mali. The town sprawls across nearly 125 acres, with the remains of stone structures that include commercial and residential compounds, caravanserais, mosques, and livestock enclosures. Surrounding these are cemeteries where tombstones bear Arabic inscriptions. Cliffs that overlook the town are carved with inscriptions in Arabic and Tifinagh (the written form of Amazigh) that attest to the site's occupation as early as the tenth century.'
    -
      text: 'The town is located at the desert's southern fringe, where in the medieval period camel caravans arrived from and departed for their respective Saharan journeys. Between 2004 and 2005, archaeologist Sam Nixon partnered with colleagues from Mali's Direction nationale de patrimoine culturel and Institut des Sciences Humaines to undertake the first excavations at the isolated site of Essouk-Tadmekka.<sup><a href="/references/">12</a></sup>'

      text: 'Their findings confirm the descriptions of Tadmekka's occupation as a center of trans-Saharan trade that appear in the work of Al-Bakri and other medieval scholars writing in Arabic.'

    -
      text: 'The slightly arcing shapes of these small tubes of green glass, excavated at Essouk-Tadmekka, Mali, suggest they were likely part of small spouted bottles. Made in Egypt or western Asia, such bottles were used throughout the medieval Mediterranean as containers for perfume or rose water. Material remnants of the long-distance trade of luxury glassware, fragments of glass vessels, such as this example from the Corning Museum, have also been found at other medieval sites north and south of the Sahara Desert.'

      text: 'The commodities and manufactured goods that moved along trans-Saharan trade routes were often destined for markets at astonishing distances from their places of origin. A small fragment of celadon porcelain that was excavated at the site of Essouk-Tadmekka, Mali, is a type known as Qingbai ware.'
    -
      text: 'Produced in southeastern China, Qingbai pottery was widely exported between the tenth and twelfth century and was exchanged along routes moving from market to market in a process called relay trade. Fragments of Qingbai ware have been found at medieval sites from Central Asia to Egypt and across the Sahara.'
    -
      text: 'The shape of this fragment suggests that it once formed part of the rim of a bowl. The distinctive damask weave of [a small piece of silk](#/silk-fragment), also excavated at Essouk-Tadmekka, proves that it was likewise made by Chinese artisans, though the chain-stitch embroidery in red cotton that runs across it was likely added in Tadmekka as further embellishment to a luxury garment.'

      text: 'Vast amounts of unglazed ceramic fragments&mdash;the remains of bottles, bowls, jars, storage containers, and other items essential to daily life&mdash;have been excavated at multiple sites in the Western Sudan region and even north of the Sahara at sites including Sijilmasa. Decorated with imprinted roulette patterns or slip-painted motifs, these vessels were used domestically for cooking and food storage. Such terracotta containers also transported commodities including grains and fish from Mali's fertile Inland Niger Delta across vast distances.'
