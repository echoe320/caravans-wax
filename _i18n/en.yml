    title: 'Tour'
    caption: 'During the medieval period, major trade routes crossing the Sahara Desert linked cities and towns that functioned as trade centers. Routes headed south connected with the Niger River, a major byway to Africa’s forest region. Those going north connected to the vast trade networks of the Mediterranean Sea, traveling inland across Europe. Routes headed east met the Levantine routes and ultimately the Silk Roads of Central and East Asia.'

The main routes across the Sahara were established by the fifth century CE, and most continue to be used today. In this section the sites of Sijilmasa, Tadmekka, and Gao are presented as case studies that reveal the history of medieval West Africa.'

While archaeological finds, medieval Arabic texts, and oral narratives are important resources for understanding Africa’s past, they tell us little about daily life in the Sahara Desert during the medieval period. In the absence of critical historical sources, it is helpful to turn to more recent material and cultural practices of Saharan Imazighen peoples—many of which have enduring connections to the past—to provide a path for imagining the past.<sup><a href=\"/references/\">3</a></sup>'

Camels are ideal for Saharan movement: they rarely sweat, even in hot desert climates, and can conserve fluids for long periods of time.<sup><a href=\"/references/\">4</a></sup> With camels to ride and to carry loads, the Tuareg and other Imazighen peoples of the Sahara once controlled the caravan routes that stretched across the desert.'

This Tekna headdress is made of braided and knotted synthetic hair, though in the past the hairs of a horse’s tail would have been used. Horses as well as the glass, silver, coral, shell, and hardstone beads that are used to the headdress harken back to the medieval circulation of these valued materials, exemplifying how the legacy of the past continues to impact the present.'

It lies in the Tafilalt Oasis, a basin of alluvial soils. Sijilmasa was a vital link in the African gold trade. Its mint struck gold coins as early as the tenth century, and evidence strongly suggests that West African gold passed through the area by the fourth century. While much of Sijilmasa was abandoned in the late fourteenth century, parts of the city, such as the great mosque, were used until the turn of the twentieth century.'

    -
      text: "The ruins of Essouk-Tadmekka (also called Tadmekka) lie in northeastern Mali. The town sprawls across nearly 125 acres, with the remains of stone structures that include commercial and residential compounds, caravanserais, mosques, and livestock enclosures. Surrounding these are cemeteries where tombstones bear Arabic inscriptions. Cliffs that overlook the town are carved with inscriptions in Arabic and Tifinagh (the written form of Amazigh) that attest to the site's occupation as early as the tenth century."

      text: "The town is located at the desert's southern fringe, where in the medieval period camel caravans arrived from and departed for their respective Saharan journeys.

      text: 'While terracotta beads were likely produced locally, finished glass beads were imported to Gao from bead-making centers in North Africa, Egypt, Europe, and the West African forest region. The presence of crucibles for melting glass and of malformed beads at Gao Saney suggests that it was a secondary glass bead production site in which broken glass was melted for bead making.'

      text: "From its source in the Guinea Highlands, the Niger River moves northeastward into the plains of the Western Sudan. There, between the Niger and its tributary the Bani River, flooding creates a fertile zone called the Inland Niger Delta. Its rich soils gave rise to a thriving regional urbanism by the fourth century. Above the Inland Niger Delta, the Middle Niger region extends along the river's wide arc, with cities on its banks that sit close to the Sahara Desert."
    -
      text: 'The Niger River was the main east&mdash;west throughway in the Western Sudan for transportation and exchange long before the escalation of trans-Saharan trade began in the eighth century. Saharan trade intersected with this lively exchange and contributed to the development of the powerful states of Ghana (seventh&ndash;thirteenth century), Mali (thirteenth&ndash;sixteenth century), and Songhai (fourteenth&ndash;sixteenth century) during the Middle Ages.'
    -
      text: 'Residents of the Inland Niger Delta and the Middle Niger spoke Mande languages similar to those spoken at the sources of gold.

This later bead was cast in silver and then covered with a thin layer of gold over its surface, a technique called gilding.
