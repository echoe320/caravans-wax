    title: 'Tour'
    caption: 'During the medieval period, major trade routes crossing the Sahara Desert linked cities and towns that functioned as trade centers. Routes headed south connected with the Niger River, a major byway to Africa’s forest region. Those going north connected to the vast trade networks of the Mediterranean Sea, traveling inland across Europe. Routes headed east met the Levantine routes and ultimately the Silk Roads of Central and East Asia.'

The main routes across the Sahara were established by the fifth century CE, and most continue to be used today. In this section the sites of Sijilmasa, Tadmekka, and Gao are presented as case studies that reveal the history of medieval West Africa.'

While archaeological finds, medieval Arabic texts, and oral narratives are important resources for understanding Africa’s past, they tell us little about daily life in the Sahara Desert during the medieval period. In the absence of critical historical sources, it is helpful to turn to more recent material and cultural practices of Saharan Imazighen peoples—many of which have enduring connections to the past—to provide a path for imagining the past.<sup><a href=\"/references/\">3</a></sup>'

      text: 'Until the widespread domestication of the camel in the early centuries of the Common Era, historians believe, trans-Saharan trade and exchange was quite rare. Camels are ideal for Saharan movement: they rarely sweat, even in hot desert climates, and can conserve fluids for long periods of time.<sup><a href=\"/references/\">4</a></sup> With camels to ride and to carry loads, the Tuareg and other Imazighen peoples of the Sahara once controlled the caravan routes that stretched across the desert.'

      text: 'Their economy was based on herding and supplemented by the trade of salt. Tuareg nobility depended on artisans to produce wood, metal, and leather goods like this saddle.<sup><a href=\"/references/\">5</a></sup> This example is too ornate to have been used for lengthy travel. It was made by covering a wooden core with dyed and tooled leather and then decorating the pommel and other parts with metal embellishments filled with geometric patterns.'

      text: 'From at least the nineteenth century, the word *gnawa* has been used in Morocco to refer to the descendants of enslaved people from the Western Sudan. The term is now associated with black Moroccans who entertain in public squares and on concert stages. The guinbri is the most prestigious of all Gnawa musical instruments. This drawing of a guinbri is from the account of Danish businessman and diplomat Georg Høst of his travels in Morocco.'
    -
      text: 'Published in 1779, it is the first known mention of a guinbri in European literature.

      text: 'The Tekna live in the northwestern part of the Sahara and are descended from local Imazighen and Arabs who immigrated to the region between the fifteenth and seventeenth century. This Tekna headdress is made of braided and knotted synthetic hair, though in the past the hairs of a horse’s tail would have been used. Horses as well as the glass, silver, coral, shell, and hardstone beads that are used to the headdress harken back to the medieval circulation of these valued materials, exemplifying how the legacy of the past continues to impact the present.'

      text: 'Founded in the ninth century, Sijilmasa sits along the northern edge of the Sahara Desert in southeastern Morocco, adjacent to present-day Rissani. It lies in the Tafilalt Oasis, a basin of alluvial soils. Sijilmasa was a vital link in the African gold trade. Its mint struck gold coins as early as the tenth century, and evidence strongly suggests that West African gold passed through the area by the fourth century. While much of Sijilmasa was abandoned in the late fourteenth century, parts of the city, such as the great mosque, were used until the turn of the twentieth century.'
    -
      text: 'Between 1988 and 1998 the Moroccan-American Project at Sijilmasa (MAPS) undertook six archaeological missions at Sijilmasa. Their excavations have revealed the remains of a citadel, an ore-processing site, a mosque, and an elite residence where a small gold filigree ring was found.<sup><a href=\"/references/\">9</a></sup>  A caravanserai (a roadside inn where caravans could rest overnight), Souk Ben Akla, was located three miles west of the city on the banks of the Rheris River.'

      text: 'This gold ring is one of only a few gold objects to have survived from medieval Saharan Africa, and it is important material evidence of Sijilmasa’s link to Saharan trade. A goldsmith made the ring by soldering thin flattened strips of gold in an undulating pattern to upper and lower bands. The ring was found in an elite residence and dates to an extended period of development of the city by local Amazigh rulers, the Bani Midrar.'

    -
      text: 'While terracotta beads were likely produced locally, finished glass beads were imported to Gao from bead-making centers in North Africa, Egypt, Europe, and the West African forest region. The presence of crucibles for melting glass and of malformed beads at Gao Saney suggests that it was a secondary glass bead production site in which broken glass was melted for bead making.'

      text: "From its source in the Guinea Highlands, the Niger River moves northeastward into the plains of the Western Sudan. There, between the Niger and its tributary the Bani River, flooding creates a fertile zone called the Inland Niger Delta. Its rich soils gave rise to a thriving regional urbanism by the fourth century. Above the Inland Niger Delta, the Middle Niger region extends along the river's wide arc, with cities on its banks that sit close to the Sahara Desert."
    -
      text: 'The Niger River was the main east&mdash;west throughway in the Western Sudan for transportation and exchange long before the escalation of trans-Saharan trade began in the eighth century. Saharan trade intersected with this lively exchange and contributed to the development of the powerful states of Ghana (seventh&ndash;thirteenth century), Mali (thirteenth&ndash;sixteenth century), and Songhai (fourteenth&ndash;sixteenth century) during the Middle Ages.'
    -
      text: 'Residents of the Inland Niger Delta and the Middle Niger spoke Mande languages similar to those spoken at the sources of gold.

Using Arabic, West African scholars contributed to a widespread culture that included Islam and its associated intellectual discourse.'

The literature is challenging to interpret, with authors primarily drawing from second- or third-hand reports. Nonetheless, when viewed in conjunction with the material record, the accounts can provide valuable information.'

Indeed, slavery is made visible almost uniquely in these written accounts.'

      text: "During the medieval period, the Arabic language and the Islamic faith spread together along trade routes across the Sahara and then gradually across Africa's Western Sudan region. Few West African manuscripts from the medieval period survive today, and the earliest known date from the sixteenth century. However, the legacy of the movement of Arabic into West Africa is found in books like this *Life of the Prophet* text, which reflects the linked movement of language, faith, and trade."
    -
      text: "The scholar Al-qadi wrote a biography of the Prophet Mohammad with devotional instructions in the twelfth century. This manuscript is likely a later copy produced in North Africa and imported across the Sahara at an unknown time. It is one of about forty thousand manuscripts in the collection of Mali's Institut des hautes études et de recherches islamiques Ahmed Baba, most acquired from private family libraries in centers of Islamic learning across Mali."

The special qualities of gold&mdash;its rarity, its sparkle and reflectiveness, its malleability, and its resistance to tarnish as well as the difficulty of extracting it from the earth&mdash;all contributed to its value. Empires across North Africa, the Middle East, and Europe minted gold into coins and used it to make and to embellish luxury objects.'

Nonetheless, metal analysis also suggests that the production of copper alloys at Igbo Ukwu may have been supplemented by copper from the Sahara, particularly in the second half of its existence."

In the early twentieth century, the figure was part of the ritual life of Tada, a small village on the banks of the Niger River 120 miles north of Ife. Every Friday it was taken to the Niger River to be ritually bathed with sand and water, accompanied by chants in Yoruba, a language associated with the city of Ife.'

      text: "In the late fifteenth century, the establishment of Atlantic-coast trade with Europeans led to a decline in trade across the Sahara Desert. The establishment of trade with Europeans along Africa's Atlantic coast in the late fifteenth century effectively bypassed the series of intermediaries that were essential to Saharan trade. Ships made possible the transport of more goods. Gold, ivory, and other Saharan trade staples remained important commodities, especially in the early days of coastal trade. However, the slave trade would soon dominate the Atlantic economy."

As the gold trade shifted southward, it contributed to the creation of the Asante Empire (in today's nation of Ghana).

    description: 'Until the widespread domestication of the camel in the early centuries of the Common Era, historians believe, trans-Saharan trade and exchange was quite rare. Camels are ideal for Saharan movement: they rarely sweat, even in hot desert climates, and can conserve fluids for long periods of time. With camels to ride and to carry loads, the Tuareg and other Imazighen peoples of the Sahara once controlled the caravan routes that stretched across the desert. Their economy was based on herding and supplemented by the trade of salt. Tuareg nobility depended on artisans to produce wood, metal, and leather goods like this saddle. This example is too ornate to have been used for lengthy travel. It was made by covering a wooden core with dyed and tooled leather and then decorating the pommel and other parts with metal embellishments filled with geometric patterns. '

    description: From at least the nineteenth century, the word _gnawa_ has been used in Morocco to refer to the descendants of enslaved people from the Western Sudan. The term is now associated with black Moroccans who entertain in public squares and on concert stages. The _guinbri_ is the most prestigious of all Gnawa musical instruments. This drawing of a _guinbri_ is from the account of Danish businessman and diplomat Georg Høst of his travels in Morocco. Published in 1779, it is the first known mention of a _guinbri_ in European literature. The instrument may derive from one that the fourteenth-century Muslim traveler Ibn Battuta described as being played at the court of the Mali Empire and that he called the _gunburi_.

    description: 'The Tekna live in the northwestern part of the Sahara and are descended from local Imazighen and Arabs who immigrated to the region between the fifteenth and seventeenth century. This Tekna headdress is made of braided and knotted synthetic hair, though in the past the hairs of a horse’s tail would have been used. Horses as well as the glass, silver, coral, shell, and hardstone beads that are used to the headdress harken back to the medieval circulation of these valued materials, exemplifying how the legacy of the past continues to impact the present.'

    description: 'Sijilmasa was a sizeable and wealthy urban center in its heyday. The Andalusian historian and geographer Abu ‘Ubayd al-Bakri (d. 1094) described the city as “a wall with twelve gates. Within are beautiful houses, many having gardens, magnificent public buildings, a mosque that is solidly built, and baths that are poorly built.” This fragment of painted plaster bears a portion of an inscription from the Qur’an that would have read in full, “On no soul doth God place a burden greater than it can bear. It gets every good that it earns, and it suffers every ill that it earns.” It was found at the site of an elite residence of the ninth or tenth century. Just a century or two later, a mosque was built on the same location.'

    description: 'This gold ring is one of only a few gold objects to have survived from medieval Saharan Africa, and it is important material evidence of Sijilmasa’s link to Saharan trade. A goldsmith made the ring by soldering thin flattened strips of gold in an undulating pattern to upper and lower bands. The ring was found in an elite residence and dates to an extended period of development of the city by local Amazigh rulers, the Bani Midrar. The gold-working technique resembles that of nineteenth- and twentieth-century Amazigh jewelry from the Sahara and Anti-Atlas Mountains.'

Fragments of Qingbai ware have been found at medieval sites from Central Asia to Egypt and across the Sahara. The shape of this fragment suggests that it once formed part of the rim of a bowl.'

    description: 'This small crucible recovered from the site of Gao Saney was used in glass bead making. Glass beads, which were produced at many locales and exchanged across vast distances, provide a microcosm for considering the complex networks that met at Gao Saney. Approximately two-thirds of the beads are from the lower occupation levels, dated to the eighth to tenth century, and many of those were found in trenches in broken, malformed, or unfinished condition. The evidence from these trenches is especially compelling, suggesting that Gao Saney was a production site for recycling and remaking imported glass. At Gao Ancien, in contrast, most excavated beads had been finished. '

The large fragment of lusterware (center) and of splashware (right) were excavated at Gao in Mali, as was the piece of carved alabaster (left), which likely came from a source in Egypt or Syria. Lusterware was among the most ingenious innovations of Arab potters, who mixed silver sulfides and copper oxides to create a shiny, metallic sheen on the surface of glazed earthenware bowls, plates, and other utilitarian vessels. The decorative ware was popular in Egypt and greater Syria during the Fatimid period (909–1171). The technique also spread to North Africa and Andalusia, including the cities of Malaga and Valencia. Wide appreciation of lusterware is unsurprising given the pottery’s similarities to the shimmering sparkle of gold.'

This later bead was cast in silver and then covered with a thin layer of gold over its surface, a technique called gilding. The surface of the bead is embellished with wire filigree, thin metal strips applied in a pattern, and granulation, small spheres of gold.

The twelfth-century marble grave monument  from the cemetery that lies near the archaeological site of Gao Saney, Mali, is inscribed with a poem inspired by a Qur’anic verse that reads in part, “... alone, He has no partner, and Muhammed is His servant and His messenger. He lived and died faithful to this religion and will live again if it is God’s will—May God have mercy on whomever asks for mercy for him.” It is likely one of a pair of stones; the other would have borne the name, title, and dates of a member of Gao’s ruling class. The stone is one of five surviving monuments made in Alméria, Spain, and transported across the Sahara Desert for clients in Gao.'

Few West African manuscripts from the medieval period survive today, and the earliest known date from the sixteenth century. However, the legacy of the movement of Arabic into West Africa is found in books like this _Life of the Prophet_ text, which reflects the linked movement of language, faith, and trade. The scholar Al-qadi wrote a biography of the Prophet Mohammad with devotional instructions in the twelfth century. This manuscript is likely a later copy produced in North Africa and imported across the Sahara at an unknown time. It is one of about forty thousand manuscripts in the collection of Mali’s Institut des hautes études et de recherches islamiques Ahmed Baba, most acquired from private family libraries in centers of Islamic learning across Mali.'

The book, which was composed in Italian, was the first description of Africa published in Europe for a largely European and Christian readership hungry to know more about the continent’s geography, people, and resources.

    description: The origins of trans-Saharan gold trade likely date to the fourth century CE. Roman outposts in North Africa were well positioned to undertake this trade and to disseminate gold and other commodities into the wider Roman world. The first gold solidus coin, featuring a portrait of the emperor Honorius in profile, was issued by the Roman Empire in 312 and weighed 4.5 grams.  The measure and its increments became standard units for weighing gold wherever Roman coins were used, and they continued to be used by Islamic states in North Africa and the Middle East during the Middle Ages. It is possible that this system was also transferred via trans-Saharan trade to West Africa, where it was used in the nineteenth-century gold weights in the Akan region of Ghana.

Introduced in the seventh century, dinars were minted at sites throughout the Mediterranean, often using West African gold. A dinar was of significant value and was primarily used only for large expenditures. This dinar was minted at Sijilmasa, Morocco, which was one of the most productive mints due to its close proximity to the West African gold sources. The inscription on the dinar records the political leadership of Abu ‘Inan Faris and establishes Sijilmasa as a major center of trade and production."

A mint mark appears above John the Baptist’s right hand, indicating where the coin was produced. Florins could also be hammered out to form valuable gold leaf, which was used to embellish objects including religious paintings.'

    description: Medieval Christian artworks were often embellished with gold leaf. In this panel painting from Italy, Christ places a crown on the head of his mother Mary, symbolizing her role as Queen of Heaven. Angels and other holy figures fill the heavenly space that is conveyed by the golden background. Much of the gold used in Italy came from West Africa through trans-Saharan trade routes. Beginning in the thirteenth century, Italian city-states such as Florence and Venice began minting gold coins largely made from West African gold. These coins were beaten into thin sheets of foil, which were then used as gold leaf. From one coin, craftsmen could make more than one hundred leaves.

Its rulers vied with the Umayyads of Spain for access to West African gold and for control of major trading cities like Sijilmasa. This large and elaborate Fatimid bead is composed of two filigree cones joined along a central seam, a shape that originates from antiquity. Filigree is a complex technique that is based on the soldering of fine-gauge wires to a base sheet, where goldsmiths twist thin sheets of metal and create a visually compelling decoration. Biconical beads became dispersed widely across the Mediterranean and the Sahara in the medieval period. Small terracotta beads from Gao, Mali, feature the same double-cone shape, showing evidence of this form’s movement."

Today more than one hundred of its 600 pages are dispersed in collections around the world and more than sixty
    are still in Tunisia. Although scholars disagree on the precise origins of this sumptuous book, the use of gold and silver script on parchment colored a deep blue nevertheless signals competition with the expensive purple-dyed manuscripts (from the murex sea snail) also circulating in courts around the Mediterranean basin. During the medieval period, a shared manuscript culture among Muslims, Christians, and Jews extended across North Africa, the Middle East, and Europe. Common elements in this manuscript tradition included elegant calligraphy, colorful embellishments including gold, and decorative leather bindings. Gold and leather, both prominently used in bookmaking, were imported from West Africa. Book culture likewise spread to West Africa as Islam spread across the Sahara Desert."

    description: 'This siddur, a Jewish prayer book, reflects a taste for delicate tracery penwork. Key pages are also embellished with gold leaf and watercolor. Gold&mdash;much of it coming from West Africa&mdash;was an important artistic material across the three of the major Mediterranean faiths of the medieval period: Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. Jewish artisans, who often worked with gold, made significant contributions to art and culture during the Middle Ages, creating works for Jewish, Muslim, and Christian clients.'

    description: "Ivory tusks were among the luxury commodities traded across the Sahara Desert alongside gold. Two elephant subspecies are found in West Africa: the Savanna elephant, which is the largest of all elephant species, and the forest elephant. The tusks of both elephants were circulated through medieval trans-Saharan trade. Large-scale Virgin and Child statuettes represent the apex of ivory carving in the medieval period in France, and this sculpture is among the largest. Measuring 16.5 cm in diameter at its widest point, the solid statuette could only have been  made from the tusk of a Savanna elephant. The artist has maximized the size of the figures of the Virgin and Child obtained from the large tusk and augmented it further by adding separate ivory pieces to make the throne. This statuette was finished with fine details in paint and gold. "

    description: 'This ivory box, or casket, was made on the island of Sicily, off the southern tip of Italy, not long after the Norman conquest. The Arabic-speaking Muslim population of Sicily was not entirely displaced by the Normans, and these communities—and their commercial connections—contributed significantly to a unique visual culture that flourished under Norman rule. The box is embellished with gold leaf and copper fittings, valuable materials that circulated along with ivory across networks that were central to trans-Saharan trade. An inscription in Arabic reads “May glory endure.”'

    description: This densely embroidered textile fragment depicting the Coronation of the Virgin, a popular Christian story of the period, was likely once part of a vestment, or ceremonial robe. While documents of the period suggest that luxurious embroidered garments were worn by the elite, the majority of surviving embroideries were made for use in the church.  Generous amounts of gold thread are incorporated into the scene. Despite the discovery of gold deposits in Europe in the later Middle Ages, West African gold continued to be highly prized for its quality and purity. A mid-seventeenth-century shipwreck offers compelling evidence for the export of West African gold to England. The ship sank off the coast of Devon, England, carrying scraps of gold jewelry, ingots, and more than 400 gold coins, most of them minted in Morocco between the eleventh and seventeenth century.

    description: "This standing figure from the Nok Culture in North-Central Nigeria is one of the oldest known terracotta sculptures to be excavated from a site in Africa.
    \ Dating to the first century CE, it is one of over 1,000 such figures that have
    been excavated in the region, pointing to a rich material culture in the Central
    Sudan long before the medieval period. The figure is depicted wearing a beaded necklace
    and belt, providing evidence that beads were already deeply ingrained culturally
    and tied to leadership and wealth before medieval trans-Saharan trade increased
    the availability of glass beads in the region. These are likely semi-precious stone
    beads, which have been found in abundance at Nok sites. \nThe corpus of sculptures
    from Nok, considered the earliest known terracotta sculptures from Africa south
    of the Sahara Desert, are among the ancient traditions that have been threatened
    by illegal looting in Western Africa. Protecting these and other examples of tangible
    and intangible cultural heritage is essential for passing this heritage on to future
    generations. "

    description: "This blue glass armlet was excavated from a royal grave at Igbo Ukwu. Thurstan Shaw, who led excavations at the site, found that many beads from the site are distinguished by high lime and high aluminum content. The discovery of a bead workshop producing high-lime and high-aluminum beads 389 kilometers southeast at a site called Igbo Olokun, within the city of Ife, supports the hypothesis that these unique beads were made and exchanged locally.  Yet, of the 165,000 stone and glass beads found at Igbo Ukwu, many are also traceable to the Mediterranean, the Levant, the Middle East, Arabia, and India. Beads at the site offer an interesting look into the polity’s connections to local and long-distance trade networks, including those crossing the Sahara."

    description: 'This ornament, which would have crowned a staff or pole, is the earliest known representation of a horse and rider from Africa’s central forest region. How the object was made is an open question. Horses cannot survive in the forest for long due to fly-borne disease. It is possible that horses were imported, at great expense, along routes of exchange with the Western Sudan and North Africa. Another possibility is that another object representing a horse and rider was imported, inspiring an artist to make this ornament. The rider is depicted wearing beaded regalia as well as facial scarifications associated today with elite titleholders.'

Its textured surface highlights the artistry and technological skill of the city’s bronze-casting workshops. The raised ropes and dots that embellish the pendant evoke the abundant number of beads, also found at Igbo Ukwu, that circulated along local and long-distance trade routes. Many of the copper alloy objects found at the site were designed to be decorated with glass beads; this pendant of a bird and two eggs was found alongside yellow beads and copper wires that attached through loops cast along the object’s side.'

    description: 'The style and the extraordinarily thin casting of this naturalistic figure point to its likely creation at Ife, the royal capital of a powerful kingdom. In the early twentieth century, the figure was part of the ritual life of Tada, a small village on the banks of the Niger River 120 miles north of Ife. Every Friday it was taken to the Niger River to be ritually bathed with sand and water, accompanied by chants in Yoruba, a language associated with the city of Ife. During the medieval period, Tada’s location would have been of strategic importance to Ife, connecting it with long-distance trade. Analysis of the raw copper from which the statue is made suggests that it might have originated in France and traveled along these very trade routes to Ife, where it was cast.'

The figure also wears a large medallion, necklaces, armlets, and anklets strung with cowrie shells. Cowries from the Indian Ocean were used as currency in parts of medieval West Africa and might have been transported overland to Central Nigeria along east-west routes or across the Sahara and down the Niger River before they could serve as an artistic reference for the creator of this figure.'

    description: These stylized terracotta heads of an elephant and a hippopotamus are portrayed in the splendid regalia of the ruling elite of Ife, including headdresses and necklaces embellished with beads of different sizes. The association of these powerful animals with political leaders is almost certainly a statement of authority. Elephant and hippopotamus tusks were valuable commodities in the interregional trade that followed the Niger River and connected with trans-Saharan routes of exchange.

    description: 'These long brass ingots were buried within an elite grave at Durbi Takusheyi along with other copper-alloy objects made locally and imported from North of the Sahara. Copper was a sought-after commodity in trans-Saharan trade that was mined from sources in the Sahara and in Europe. The exchange of copper transported southward across the Sahara for gold is described in the mid-tenth century by ‘Ishāq Ibn al-Ḥusayn’: “Their country (the Sudan) has much gold, but the people there prefer brass to gold.”  The origins of the metals alloyed to make these ingots is not clear. However, a preliminary isotopic analysis of the ingots and the copper-alloy objects cast in Durbi Takusheyi suggests possible sources in France, the Iberian Peninsula, and the Middle East. Thin rod-shaped copper ingots dated between the eleventh and thirteenth century were found at Ma’den Ifajen, Mauritania, and at Natamatao, Mali. Recent excavations at Tamdult, Morocco, by a Moroccan/UK team (Institut National des Sciences de l’Archéologie et du Patrimoine/British Museum) have recorded fragments of molds that would have produced ingots with a similar form to those excavated at Durbi Takusheyi.'

    description: This Mamluk bowl, which was made in Egypt or Syria, was recovered from a burial at Durbi Takusheyi, Nigeria. The decorative patterns and Arabic inscription that encircle the bowl were originally inlaid with silver and gold, and placed within it were five pieces of gold jewelry, possibly imported from the Western Sudan region, as well as cowrie shells, and brass and silver armlets. In the Mamluk Sultanate, vessels like this were made by specialized metalworkers, the nahassin, for the society's elite who used them as spectacular display pieces and diplomatic gifts. Several Mamluk-period brass bowls have also been preserved at shrines in northern Ghana, to the west of Durbi Takusheyi. These objects are evidence of active trade in luxury wares across the Sahara from the Mamluk Sultantate (1250-1517).

The gold-working techniques manifested in the gold jewelry at Durbi Takusheyi point to trade connections across West Africa. The circular pendant, with its five dome-shaped cabochons, is reminiscent of techniques used to make a pendant known as the Rao Pectoral from Senegal, while the earrings recall tenth-century Amazigh silverwork.'

These include the degree of sophistication and expertise of glass bead makers, the scale of production, and the transformations it brought to the society locally, regionally, and transregionally. Examination of the glass bead assemblage from Igbo Olokun has shown that beads were made using the drawing technique in which molten glass is pulled into tubes. '

    description: 'This bowl was discovered in 1909 during dredging for gold along the banks of the Offin River in southern Ghana. Its formal similarity to Mamluk brass bowls and basins of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries that were imported across the Sahara Desert in the late medieval period provides compelling evidence that the making of Akan kuduo was inspired by the north-east African imports.  The bowl’s profile and the placement of its surface decoration are almost identical to Mamluk period Arabic-inscribed bowls; however, details such as the use of a pseudo script—an attempt by an artist unfamiliar with Arabic to capture the formal essence of Arabic calligraphy—and the representation of stylized crocodiles and mudfish, inhabitants of the Akan forest, in two of the eight medallions show how a local artist may have reinterpreted important visual elements.'

    description: 'As European merchants shifted their attention to Africa’s Atlantic coast in the late 15th century, the direction of the gold trade also shifted. In response, new states arose in Africa’s Akan-speaking regions, and aspects of the Saharan gold trade were transferred to this new market. For instance, the Akan system for weighing gold was based on the mithqal, a unit of weight equal to 4.5 grams (0.16 ounce). The Akan gold economy gave rise to an array of striking new objects for measuring gold: scoops, spoons, boxes, and especially copper-alloy weights in a great variety of forms, some of which also reference the geometric designs of the Muslim Saharan world.'

During this period the English produced guinea coins marked with an elephant-and-castle motif below a bust of the English king, James II. The motif was stamped only onto coins made from West African gold acquired by the newly established Royal Africa Company, which was granted a monopoly on this trade by the British crown in 1672. This iconography illustrates the continuing importance of gold and ivory as commodities, even as trade shifted away from Saharan routes.'
