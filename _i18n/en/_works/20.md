description: Originally a grindstone, the bottom half of an apparatus for processing
  grain, this stone was inscribed with Arabic script by a local artisan at some time
  between the thirteenth and seventeenth century and repurposed as a grave monument
  at the same cemetery. Its accompanying top stone, used for processing grain in tandem
  with the grindstone, was likewise inscribed with Arabic script.
