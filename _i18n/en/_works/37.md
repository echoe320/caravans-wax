description: "This standing figure from the Nok Culture in North-Central Nigeria is
  one of the oldest known terracotta sculptures to be excavated from a site in Africa.
  \ Dating to the first century CE, it is one of over 1,000 such figures that have
  been excavated in the region, pointing to a rich material culture in the Central
  Sudan long before the medieval period. The figure is depicted wearing a beaded necklace
  and belt, providing evidence that beads were already deeply ingrained culturally
  and tied to leadership and wealth before medieval trans-Saharan trade increased
  the availability of glass beads in the region. These are likely semi-precious stone
  beads, which have been found in abundance at Nok sites. \nThe corpus of sculptures
  from Nok, considered the earliest known terracotta sculptures from Africa south
  of the Sahara Desert, are among the ancient traditions that have been threatened
  by illegal looting in Western Africa. Protecting these and other examples of tangible
  and intangible cultural heritage is essential for passing this heritage on to future
  generations. "
