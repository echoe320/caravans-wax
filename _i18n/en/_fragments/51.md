description: In 1992 a shipwreck was discovered off the coast of Devon, England. The
  ship sank in the mid-17th century on its way from North Africa to England. Its cargo
  included more than 400 gold coins, most of them minted in Morocco in the sixteenth
  and seventeenth centuries, as well as gold ingots and jewelry. Mostly worn and broken,
  these gold objects were on their way to be melted down and repurposed. Today, these
  rare items provide compelling evidence of the export of African gold to Europe.
