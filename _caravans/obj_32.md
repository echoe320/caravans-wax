label: This statuette of the Virgin and Child, among the largest of its kind, is demonstrative
  of the peak of ivory carving in the Gothic period of France.It features separately
  joined pieces of ivory for the throne and fine details rendered in paint and gold.
  Ivory was among the commodities traded across the desert in the Medieval period.
  With a 16.5 centimeter diameter at its most wide, the statuette could only have
  been carved from the tusk of an African Savanna elephant. Thus, it speaks directly
  to the distance and importance of trans-Saharan trade for European Medieval art.
  The piece has both West African material in the ivory and European iconography.
  This juxtaposition sheds light on the importance of trans-Saharan trade for Europe
  in the Global Medieval period.
