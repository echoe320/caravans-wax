label: 'The Jewish cartographer Abraham Cresques was commissioned to produce this
  map for Charles V, the king of France. It was completed in 1375. Mansa Musa, the
  emperor of Mali, is prominently depicted on the second panel seated on a throne
  and holding a golden orb in one handed. The caption reads: “This Moorish ruler is
  named Musse Melly [Mansa Musa], lord of the Negroes of Guinea. This king is the
  richest and most distinguished ruler of this whole region on account of the great
  quantity of gold that is found in his lands.” The Catalan Atlas demonstrates the
  significant European interest in West Africa and the trans-Saharan networks that
  connected the two at this time. It reveals that European saw themselves as part
  of an interconnected world that included a vital West Africa.'
