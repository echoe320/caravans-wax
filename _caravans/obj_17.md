label: This biconical, or double-cone shaped bead, made in the late nineteenth or
  early twentieth century, shares the shape of biconical beads from the Medieval period.
  It is likely that the style continued to be produced in the region from eleventh
  century onward. The beads are not exactly comparable. The more bead was cast in
  silver and gilded with golding silver. The surface of the bead is embellished with
  wire filigree and granulation. Filigree and granulation are both techniques that
  uses intricate pieces of metal to create a decorative pattern. In the filigree technique,
  goldsmiths use thin pieces of metal and twist them into patterns, while granulation
  is a technique where small spheres are pieced together to create a pattern.
