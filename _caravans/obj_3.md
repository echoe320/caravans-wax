label: In this Tekna headdress, knotted and twisted synthetic hair is decorated with colorful beads. Ebony, silver, coral, glass, shells, and semiprecious stones are intricately stitched into the hairs. Each bead recalls the travel and exchange of these very same materials throughout the decades of the exhibition, exemplifying the legacy of the medieval period in more recent times.
