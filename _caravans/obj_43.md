label: These four pieces of solid gold jewelry were excavated among the valuable grave
  goods of a high-status individual buried at Durbi Takusheyi in north-central Nigeria.
  They were deposited with strung cowrie shells in the large Mamluk brass bowl (see
  next page.) The hoop earrings are made with of inner and outer petal-like forms
  with a pseudo-granulation texture. This technique is comparable to Amazigh earrings,
  collected near Algiers in the early twentieth century. The gold however is likely
  sourced from places that contributed to trans-Saharan trade such as Bambuk, Bure
  or the Upper Volta. The pendant, however has five soldered cabochon ornaments and
  is outlined with braided filigree, which is very similar in craftsmanship to the
  Rao Pectoral and the jewelry from the Salcombe Bay treasure. This pendant was most
  likely traded and traveled as a finished object over West Africa, and therefore
  had different origins from the earrings. These treasures were acquired through trade
  in multiple directions, and therefore provide evidence for a far reaching interaction.
  Studies of the gold jewelry indicate that they were likely made in Senegal or southern
  Mauritania, while the other cowrie shells originated in the Indian Ocean and would
  have traveled along the same routes of trade as the brass bowl.
