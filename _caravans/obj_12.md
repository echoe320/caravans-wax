label: Vast amounts of unglazed ceramic fragments— the remains of bottles, bowls,
  jars, storage containers, and other items essential to daily life—have been excavated
  at multiple sites in the Western Sudan region, and even north of the Sahara at sites
  including Sijilmasa. This distribution across sites from the Inland Niger Delta
  to the Northern Sahara has led archaeologists to speculate that ceramic containers
  were used to carry goods, such as shea butter or honey, short and long distances
  in trade. They are decorated with imprinted roulette patterns or slip-painted motifs.
  Some of the fragments are predicted to have been parts of containers for products
  like shea butter and honey. Because of their distribution across sites from the
  Inland Niger Delta to the Northern Sahara archaeologists speculate that ceramic
  containers were used to carry goods, such as shea butter or honey, short and long
  distances in trade.
