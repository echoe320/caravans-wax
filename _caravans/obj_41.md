label: 'Copper was a sought-after commodity in trans-Saharan trade that was mined
  from sources in the Sahara and also in Europe. Gold was commonly traced for copper
  south of the Sahara, which is described in the mid-tenth century by ‘Ishāq Ibn
  al-Ḥusayn’: \"Their country (the Sudan) has much gold, but the people there prefer
  brass to gold. From the brass they make ornaments for their women.\" The origins
  of the metals alloyed to make these ingots is not clear. However, a preliminary
  isotopic analysis of the ingots and the copper-alloy objects cast in Durbi Takusheyi
  suggests possible sources in France, the Iberian Peninsula, and the Middle East.
  Similar ingots have been found in three other sites, bu tonly those recently excavated
  by Sam Nixon in Tamdult have the identical triangular shape, whereas the others
  found in Maden Ifajen and Natamatao are cylindrical. These ingots were later made
  into jewelry or regalia and sculpture, like the leglets, armlet, leg bracelets,
  and heavy arm rings also found in the burials. However, these long brass ingots
  were buried as grave goods and it is believed that they were exclusively made to
  symbolize commodity and indicate wealth. '
